The Xerces Perl project has created a Perl module, Xerces.pm, as the Perl
API to the Apache project's Xerces XML parser. It is implemented using
the Xerces C++ API, and it provides access to all of the C++ API from
Perl.

Because it is based on Xerces-C, Xerces.pm provides a validating XML parser
that makes it easy to give your application the ability to read and write
XML data. A shared library is provided for parsing, generating, manipulating,
and validating XML documents. Xerces.pm is faithful to the XML 1.0
recommendation and associated standards ( DOM 1.0, DOM 2.0. SAX 1.0, SAX
2.0, Namespaces), The parser provides high performance, modularity, and
scalability. Source code, samples and API documentation are provided with
the parser.

The majority of the API is created automatically using Simplified Wrapper
Interface Generator (SWIG).  However, care has been taken to make most
method invocations natural to perl programmers, so a number of rough C++
edges have been smoothed over (See the Special Perl API Features section).
