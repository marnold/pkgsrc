Python XmlTools is a set of high level tools to help using XML in
python. It relies heavily on PyXml and 4Suite to access XML
resources. Right now it features two pyGTK widgets: XmlTree and
XmlEditor, which can respectively display and edit an XML document in
a graphical fashion. Both widgets are used in the NARVAL project.
