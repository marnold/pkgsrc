Namazu is a full-text search system intended for easy use. Not only it works
as a CGI program for a small or medium scale Web search engine, but also works
as a personal use search system for your pile of email. 

(The Japanese word `Namazu' means `catfish' in English.)

Note: Namazu's newer version already exists.  Since index file format has
changed, this pacakge is provided for users who want to continute to use
existing index files.
