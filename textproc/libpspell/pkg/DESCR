  The goal of the library is to provide a generic interface to Spell checker
libraries installed on the system.

  The Pspell library contains two main classes and several helper classes.
The two main classes are PspellConfig and PspellMaster.  The PspellConfig
class is used to set initial defaults and to change spell checker-specific
options.  The PspellManager class does most of the real work.  It is
responsible for managing the dictionaries, checking if a word is in the
dictionary, and coming up with suggestions among other things.  There are many
helper classes the important ones are PspellWordList, PspellMutableWordList,
Pspell*Emulation.  The PspellWordList classes is used for accessing the
suggestion list, as well as the personal and suggestion word list currently in
use.  The PspellMutableWordList is used to manage the personal, and perhaps
other, word lists.  The Pspell*Emulation classes are used for iterating
through a list.
