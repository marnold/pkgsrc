xlhtml is used to convert Microsoft Excel Spreadsheet files into either html or
tab delimitted ASCII. The program can be interfaced with helper scripts for
viewing email attachments. Most use of this program is through the helper
scripts  and one would probably rarely resort to using the commandline 
interface.
