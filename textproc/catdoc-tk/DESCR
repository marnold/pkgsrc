catdoc behaves much like cat(1) but reads MS-Word file and
produces  human-readable text on standard output.  Option-
ally it can use latex(1) escape sequences  for  characters
which  have special meaning for LaTeX.  It also makes some
effort to recognize  MS-Word  tables,  although  it  never
tries  to write correct headers for LaTeX tabular environ-
ment.

This package provides the wordview program that comes with
catdoc, which requires Tk and X11.
