  The xml-i18n-tools module contains some utility scripts and assorted auto*
magic for internationalizing various kinds of XML files.  This supersedes the
earlier scripts that Kenneth distributed to be checked into each module.
In addition, it has an additional merging feature, currently only for oaf
files.  This feature might be extented to handle .desktop files and MIME files
in the future.  Features:

    * Automatically extracts translatable strings from oaf, glade, bonobo
      ui, nautilus theme and other XML files into the po files.

    * Automatically merges translations from po files back into .oaf files
      (encoding to be 7-bit clean). I can also extend this merging
      mechanism to support other types of XML files.

  Having the translations directly in the XML file is critical for some file
formats, and very helpful for others. When one package installs a file and
a program from another package might at some time read it, you need to have
the translations directly in the file, since the app reading the data file
will not know which message catalog to use.

  The beauty of this extract and merge system is that it works through the
existing po mechanism, so translators will be able to work in their normal way,
and be notified of strings that change, or new strings that are added, with
existing tools.
