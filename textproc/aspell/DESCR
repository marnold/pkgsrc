Aspell is an Open Source spell checker designed to eventually replace
Ispell. Its main feature is that it does a much better job of coming up
with possible suggestions than Ispell does. In fact recent tests shows
that it even does better than Microsoft Word 97's spell checker in some
cases. In addition it has both compile time and run time support for other
non English languages. Aspell is also a library however the recommend way
to use aspell is through the Pspell library as the actual interface to the
aspell library is constantly changing.
