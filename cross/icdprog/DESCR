icdprog - a programmer for Microchip PIC controllers.

ICDPROG is a simple command line programmer for Microchip PIC controllers,
using the Microchip or Olimex ICD (in circuit debugger) as a programmer.
The program is written for command line usage.

FEATURES
 * Works with PIC16F87x, x = [0,1,2,3,4,6,7] (3,7 is well tested ... )
 * Reads intel hex format
 * Auto-detects controller type

run the program with

    ./icdprog <hex file>

or

    ./icdprog -p /dev/tty01 <hex file>

if you connect the ICD to serial port #2

TODO
* Better documentation, and web page
* Add EEPROM programming support
* Add verify mode (but it verifies during programming)
* Better error checking
* Set the fuse bits from the command line
* Windows port (I need this for our production environment)
* Check sum calculation
* gdb support :-)  /* sorry, I am dreaming again ... */

MICROCHIP
If you have any problems with this software, please don't bug Microchip
with them. This software was written without any help from them
(it would have been much easier if they had released the specification
of the ICD..). Use the sourceforge forum instead.
