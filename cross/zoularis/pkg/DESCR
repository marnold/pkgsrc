This package provides the necessary header files and libraries to
install NetBSD utilities and libraries on Solaris 2.6, and has been
used to get the NetBSD packages collection working on Solaris.  It was
developed by Christos Zoulas, and has been tested on Solaris 2.6,
running on Sparc hardware.

To get this package running on Solaris, you'll need to have either
a recent gcc or egcs installed, and a version of GNU tar available,
as well as gzip.

The README file, distributed with the package itself, provides
instructions on how to build and install this environment.
