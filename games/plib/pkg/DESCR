  PLIB is a set of OpenSource (LGPL) libraries that will permit
programmers to write games and other realtime interactive
applications that are 100% portable across a wide range of hardware
and operating systems.  PLIB is OpenSource software, issued under
the terms of the Library varient GNU Public License (LGPL).

The contents of PLIB are: 

 * GUI Widgets: Picoscopic User Interface Library (PUI)
		A fully portable GUI interface that needs only
		GLUT, OpenGL and C++.

 * Sound Replay: Sound Library (SL)
		A fully portable Audio driver suited to C++, GLUT
		and realtime applications that need low latency.
		Includes a simple 'MOD' music loader/player.

 * Matrix/Vector math: Simple Geometry Library(SG)
		A set of matrix and vector math functions that was
		specifically written to simplify the writing of
		efficient OpenGL programs. You need to include
		this code into any SSG applications.

 * Scene Graph: Simple Scene Graph Library (SSG)
		A scene graph library layered on top of OpenGL.

 * Joystick: JS
		Supports more Joysticks with more axes and
		buttons than GLUT.

 * Fonts/Text: Fonts'n'Text Library (FNT)
		Supports text output in OpenGL using texture
		mapped fonts. These are much faster to render
		than GLUT's fonts.
