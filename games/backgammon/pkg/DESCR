bacKgammon is a backgammon program specifically written with the
KDE in mind. It offers the opportunity to play backgammon games by
using a convenient and intuitive graphical user interface.

bacKgammon is the direct successor of KFibs. the latter was a
program for playing backgammon games on the first internet backgammon
server (FIBS). bacKgammon is an almost complete rewrite of KFibs
to fix some of the most obvious problems:

 * improved visual appearance of the board 
 * improved user interface design: fewer dialog boxes and improved
   appearance of the main window 
 * better code design for easier maintainability and extensibility 
 * better extensibility by separating the board from the driving
   backgammon engine - include
 * your backgammon server or use the GNU backgammon engine gnubg to play 

Usage of bacKgammon does not require a connection to the Internet,
nor does it require an account on FIBS. You can use the program to
play backgammon against yourself (which might become boring after
a while) or against friends by using the offline engine.
