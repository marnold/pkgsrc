Xconq is an Empire-type strategy game, where players contest for world
domination.  In the standard game, each player (there may be up to 31)
starts with a handful of towns and cities, and may build infantry,
armor, airplanes, and a variety of ships.  Each side's movements are
hidden; speed and surprise are important.  Any or all sides may be
played by the computer.  In addition to the standard game, Xconq
includes a game design language (GDL) that can be used to define a
wide variety of games. Games already in the distribution's library
include everything from basic combat to elaborate world models, with
time periods ranging from ancient history into the distant future.
Xconq has a huge number of features, and a lengthy manual describing
them.
