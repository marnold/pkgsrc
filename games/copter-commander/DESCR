Copter Commander is a free implementation of Armor Alley and Rescue
Raiders.  R.R. was associated with a company called Sir-Tech
software, and A.A. was associated with Three Sixty Pacific.

Basically, you try to send a convoy from your part of the screen
that destroys the commanding vessel of the opposing convoy, while
protecting your own commanding vessel.

You can only directly control a helicopter, though, and the order
of creation of the new vehicles/infantry.
