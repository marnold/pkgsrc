AMOR is an acronym for Amusing Misuse of Resources. It is a small
themeable animation that sits on top of your active window. AMOR
doesn't deliberately waste resources, but of course running any
program that serves no useful purpose is wasteful.

Several themes are available for this, a kwm compatible window manager
is required (KDE's kwm and window maker are ok).
