  Keychain is an OpenSSH key manager, typically run from ~/.bash_profile.  When
  run, it will make sure ssh-agent is running; if not, it will start ssh-agent.
- It will redirect ssh-agent's output to ~/.ssh-agent, so that cron jobs that
- need to use ssh-agent keys can simply source this file and make the necessary
- passwordless ssh connections.  In addition, when keychain runs, it will check
- with ssh-agent and make sure that the ssh RSA/DSA keys that you specified on
- the keychain command line have actually been added to ssh-agent.  If not, you
- are prompted for the appropriate passphrases so that they can be added by
- keychain.
