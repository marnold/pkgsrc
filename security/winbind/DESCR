Winbind uses a UNIX implementation of Microsoft RPC calls, Pluggable
Authentication Modules, and the Name Service Switch to allow Windows NT
domain users to appear and operate as UNIX users on a UNIX machine. 
Users and groups are allocated as they are resolved to a range of user and
group ids specified by the administrator of the Samba system.
