CFS is an encrypting file system for Unix-like OSs.  It uses NFS as
its interface, and so is reasonably portable.  The FS code dates back
to 1989, and the crypto to 1992, so it is showing signs of age.  This
code should be regarded as completely unsupported; a complete rewrite
will follow eventually. 

Please don't download this code if you're in a place that's forbidden
(under US or local law) to export cryptographic software from the US
to, or if you're on the State Department's "Denied Persons List." If
you aren't sure, ask a good lawyer.
