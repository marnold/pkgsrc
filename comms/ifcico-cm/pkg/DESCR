This is an ALPHA version, it is far from being fully tested.

What's new in the 3.0.cm releases?

 * a variation of the HYDRA file transfer protocol (some less
   frequently used features aren't implemented)
 * better nodelist indices
 * incorporated tx-patches up to tx8.7
 * 'ifstat' moved from gating part to ifcico part
 * 'ifinfo' for querying nodelist information
 * 'ifreq' implementation in C (instead of Perl)

 * gating part is no longer distributed with this archive (either get
an 2.x version of ifmail or use FidoGate for gating)
