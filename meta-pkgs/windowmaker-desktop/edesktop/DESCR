The Edesktop meta-package provides a number of components for an
Enlighenment based desktop, using other components of the NetBSD packages
collection.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on other packages.  Its sole purpose is
to require dependencies so users can install this package only and
have all the other packages pulled in by the port/package dependency
mechanism.
