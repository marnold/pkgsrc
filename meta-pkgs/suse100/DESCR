The SUSE 10.0 meta-package provides a number of components for an SUSE-based
Linux binary emulation environment, using other components of the NetBSD
packages collection.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a "meta-package"
that depends on other packages.  Its sole purpose is to require dependencies
so users can install this package only and have all the other packages pulled
in automatically by the pkgsrc dependency mechanism.
