   The  goal of the Plex86 project is to create an extensible open source
   PC virtualization software program which will allow PC and workstation
   users  to  run  multiple  operating  systems  concurrently on the same
   machine.

   Plex86  will  run  as  much  of  the  operating system and application
   software  natively  as  possible,  the  rest  being emulated by the PC
   virtualization monitor.

   A  highly  visible  and  often  requested  use,  would be to allow for
   Windows  software  to  be  run  inside of GNU/Linux or other UNIX like
   operating  system.  This  gives  users  a migration path towards UNIX,
   allowing   them   to   run  legacy  software  until  native  ports  or
   alternatives  are available. It also provides a transitionary step for
   software  vendors who plan to port their product to UNIX, but have not
   yet done so. Users could buy the Windows version product and run it at
   near  native speeds on UNIX, using Plex86, until a UNIX native version
   is ready.
