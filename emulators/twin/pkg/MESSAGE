TWIN gotchas:
	* Only tested on NetBSD i386 and requires USER_LDT kernel option

	* Some w32 functions are implemented but not prototyped in the
	  TWIN headers.  Many functions are not implemented and the TWIN
	  headers are out of date.  devel/w32api may be a useful reference

	* When building programs, some libraries must be
	  explicitly linked to, unlike in Windows.  ie: you
	  need to specify -lshell to get RegOpenKeyEx()

	* The resource compiler doesn't understand "" to mean ", so replace
	  "" with \042 in your resource files.  There is no winresrc.h,
	  replace it with windows.h in your resource files.
