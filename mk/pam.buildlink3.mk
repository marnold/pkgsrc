# This Makefile fragment is meant to be included by packages that
# require a PAM implementation.  pam.buildlink3.mk will:
#
#	* set PAMBASE to the base directory of the PAM files;
#	* set PAM_TYPE to the PAM implementation used.
#
# There are two variables that can be used to tweak the selection of
# the PAM implementation:
#
# PAM_DEFAULT is a user-settable variable whose value is the default
#	PAM implementation to use.
#
# PAM_ACCEPTED is a package-settable list of PAM implementations
#	that may be used by the package.
