## For this to work, put
##   DEPENDS_TARGET=	bulk-install
##   BATCH=		yes
## into your /etc/mk.conf, then cd /usr/pkgsrc; make bulk-package
##
## bulk-install will only compile pkgs if necessary, and install binary
##	pkgs if possible/available.
## bulk-package will build binary packages, and remove them (together with
##	any depending packages) immediately after that, leaving only the
##	binary package back. Broken packages are marked (``.broken'').

# This variable is set to 'yes' by the pkgsrc/mk/bulk/build script.  It enables

# actively in the middle of a bulk build, however, we don't know that these files
# exist or are up to date and they take quite a while to rebuild.  So unless
