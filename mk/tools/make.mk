# This Makefile fragment creates a tool called "make" under ${TOOLS_DIR}
# that corresponds to the make program used to build the package.
# This lets a bare "make" invoke the correct program if called from
# within a makefile or script.  It also sets MAKE_PROGRAM to the path
# of that make program.  Lastly, pass ${MAKE_PROGRAM} to GNU configure
# scripts in the MAKE variable so that the scripts will embed the
# correct path to the make program used to build the package
# into the generated Makefiles.
#

# Define MAKE_PROGRAM to be the "make" used to build the package.
