# bootstrap.mk contains settings matching the contents of
# pkgsrc/bootstrap/bootstrap.  Where we install the bootstrap versions
# of tools, we point TOOLS_PLATFORM.* to them so that pkgsrc knows
# that they are system-supplied and won't need replacement by pkgsrc
# versions of those tools.
#
# XXX This file should go away and the bootstrap script should be
# XXX taught to write out the correct TOOLS_PLATFORM.* definitions
# XXX on its own, based on the configuration used.
