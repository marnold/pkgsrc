#
# The pthreads strategy for pkgsrc is to "bless" a particular pthread
# package as the Official Pthread Replacement (OPR).  A package that uses
# pthreads may do one of the following:
#
#   (1) Simply include pthread.buildlink2.mk.  This will make the package
#	use the native pthread library if it's available, or else the OPR
#	package.  The value of PTHREAD_TYPE may be checked to be either
#	"native", or the name of the OPR package, or "none", e.g.
#
#	#
#	# package Makefile stuff...
#	#
#	.include "../../mk/pthread.buildlink2.mk"
#
#	.if defined(PTHREAD_TYPE) && (${PTHREAD_TYPE} == "none")
#	CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-pthreads
#	.endif
#
#	.include "../../mk/bsd.pkg.mk"
#
#	Note that it's only safe to check and use the value of PTHREAD_TYPE
#	after all other buildlink2.mk files have been included.
#
#   (2) Add "native" to PTHREAD_OPTS prior to including
#	pthread.buildlink2.mk.  This is like case (1), but we only check for
#	the native pthread library, e.g.,
#
#	PTHREAD_OPTS+=	native
#	#
#	# package Makefile stuff...
#	#
#	.include "../../mk/pthread.buildlink2.mk"
#
#	.if defined(PTHREAD_TYPE) && (${PTHREAD_TYPE} == "none")
#	CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-pthreads
#	.endif
#
#	.include "../../mk/bsd.pkg.mk"
#
#   (3)	Add "require" to PTHREAD_OPTS prior to including
#	pthread.buildlink2.mk.  This will make the package use the native
#	pthread library or else use the OPR package, and will otherwise set
#	PKG_FAIL_REASON if neither can be used, e.g.,
#
#	PTHREAD_OPTS+=	require
#	#
#	# package Makefile stuff...
#	#
#	.include "../../mk/pthread.buildlink2.mk"
#	.include "../../mk/bsd.pkg.mk"
#
#   (4) Add both "require" and "native" to PTHREAD_OPTS prior to including
#	pthread.buildlink2.mk.  This is like case (3), but we only check for
#	the native pthread library, e.g.,
#
#	PTHREAD_OPTS+=	require native
#	#
#	# more package Makefile stuff...
#	#
#	.include "../../mk/pthread.buildlink2.mk"
#	.include "../../mk/bsd.pkg.mk"
#
# The case where a package must use either the native pthread library or
# some pthread package aside from the OPR is a special case of (2), e.g.,
# if the required pthread package is "ptl2", then:
#
#	PTHREAD_OPTS+=	native
#	#
#	# more package Makefile stuff...
#	#
#	.include "../../mk/pthread.buildlink2.mk"
#
#	.if defined(PTHREAD_TYPE) && (${PTHREAD_TYPE} == "none")
#	.  include "../../devel/ptl2/buildlink2.mk"
#	.endif
#
#	.include "../../mk/bsd.pkg.mk"
#
# A package Makefile may add the word "optional" to PTHREAD_OPTS, which
# will override the effects of any instance of the word "require".  This
# should _only_ be used by those packages that can be built with or
# without pthreads _independently_ of whether any of its dependencies need
# pthreads.  Currently, this only only www/mozilla, which uses its own
# threading library if native pthreads is unavailable, despite that it
# uses GTK+, which _does_ need pthreads.

###########################################################################
#
# PTHREAD_OPTS represents whether this package requires pthreads, and also
#	whether it needs to be native.  It may include the word "require"
#	to denote that a pthreads implementation is required, and may also
#	include the word "native" to denote that only native pthreads are
#	acceptable.
#
# _PKG_PTHREAD is the fall-back package pthread implementation use by
#	pthread.buildlink2.mk.
#
# _PKG_PTHREAD_COMPAT_PATTERNS matches the ONLY_FOR_PLATFORMS from the
#	Makefile for ${_PKG_PTHREAD}.  It's used to see if ${_PKG_PTHREADS}
#	can actually be used to replace a native pthreads.
