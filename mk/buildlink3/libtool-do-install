# This file is called directly by the libtool wrapper when it has
# figured out that the libtool invocation is meant to do a file
# installation.  We simply quote the remaining command-line arguments
# properly to build a correct libtool command line.  The libtool
# wrapper will perform the actual execution.  We don't worry about
# caching or speed, since installation is not a bottleneck for package
# creation.
