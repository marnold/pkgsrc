 2.1.1 - 28 Apr 2007
 	 o Welcome to GnuCash 2.1.1 aka "Bug-begone" the second of several
	 unstable releasese releases of the GnuCash Open Source Accounting
	 Software which will eventually lead to the stable version 2.2.0. With
	 this new release series, GnuCash is available on Microsoft Windows
	 for the first time, and it also runs on GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris and
	 Mac OSX. This release is intended for developers and testers who want
	 to help tracking down bugs.
	 o WARNING: Make sure you make backups of any files used in testing
	 versions of GnuCash in the 2.1.x series. Although the developers go
	 to great lengths to ensure that no data will be lost we cannot
	 guarantee that your data will not be affected if for some reason
	 GnuCash crashes in testing these releases.
	 o Please test any and all features important to you. Then post any
	 bugs you find to bugzilla
	 http://bugzilla.gnome.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=GnuCash
	 o Compared to the 2.0.x series, there are only very few user-visible
	 new features, except for the completed port to the Microsoft Windows
	 operating system. Minor new features compared to the 2.0.x series
	 are;
	 o The Scheduled Transaction Editor and Management dialogs have been
	 integrated into the overall GnuCash User Interface to give the user a
	 more consistent experience in creating scheduled transactions.
	 o Internally, the programming language wrappers are no longer being
	 generated by the not-so-well-maintained package "g-wrap" but instead
	 by the well-established wrapper generator "SWIG". In effect, gnucash
	 does no longer depend on g-wrap anymore but uses SWIG now.
	 o New printing formats for check printing
	 o Bugfixes and improvements since the last version 2.1.0 include:
	 o Start-up behaviour has been improved: Windows size is better,
	 splash screen can be clicked away
	 o OFX DirectConnect import uses correct ID fields for transaction
	 matching
	 o More Scheduled Transactions bugs have been fixed
	 o Windows: Reading/writing to compressed data files has been tested
	 more thoroughly and fixed in various places
	 o Windows: Crash on changing default currencies fixed

	 updating the documentation as all texts refer currently to the 1.8.x
	 series. Please see http://wiki.gnucash.org/wiki/Development on how to
	 get involved.

	 this release because obviously there is so much that has changed.
