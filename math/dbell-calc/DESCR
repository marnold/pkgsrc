Calc is an arbitrary precision C-like programmable calculator with many
builtin functions.  The basic data types are integers, fractions,
complex numbers, strings, matrices, associations, lists, files, and
user-definable "objects".  You can use it interactively to evaluate
expressions line by line, or else you can write complicated programs in
its C-like language.  There are many features which I will not bother
to describe here.

Calc is written entirely in C, and runs on many different platforms and
variants of UNIX.

The low-level arbitrary precision math routines have been organized into
three libraries for handling integers, fractions, and complex numbers.
You can call the routines in these libraries from your own C programs.
