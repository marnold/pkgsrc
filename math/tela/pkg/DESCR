Tela (TEnsor LAnguage) is a scientific computing language and
environment. It is mainly targeted for prototyping large-scale
numerical simulations and doing pre- and postprocessing for them, and
it replaces a compiled language like C++ or Fortran in this
respect. The feature set is therefore biased to operations needed in
partial differential equation solvers. A relatively complete graphics
is included via a separate program (PlotMTV). Tela uses HDF format as
native save/load format. It can also read/write Matlab binary files
and some ASCII files.

Tela is generally 2-4 times faster than Matlab, the extremeties
encountered so far are 0.9-11.  Even though Tela is mainly a
prototyping and development environment, modest-size 2D simulations
can be run in modern (1994) desktop workstations while preserving
"interactive" response times. Only large 2D or 3D simulations must
usually be coded in C or Fortran and run on supercomputers.
