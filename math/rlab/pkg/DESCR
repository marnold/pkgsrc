Rlab is a very high level language intended to provide fast
prototyping and program development, as well as easy
data-visualization, and processing.

The fundamental data type is a floating point matrix (either real or
complex), though RLab also includes string matrices, and sparse
numerical matrices (both real and complex).  A heterogeneous
associative array has been added to allow users to create and operate
on arbitrary data structures.
   
Rlab offers simple access to the most popular linear algebra
libraries, BLAS, and LAPACK. Furthermore, Rlab's basic data structures
are matrix oriented, with the vector dot-product an integral part of
the built-in operations.  Due to the array oriented operations, and
the high-level interface to FFTPACK, and a discrete IIR filtering
function, Rlab servers well as an environment for signal analysis and
exploration.
