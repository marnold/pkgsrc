    LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C.
It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast decompression.
Decompression requires no memory. 

    In addition, there are slower compression levels achieving a quite
competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at this very high
speed.
