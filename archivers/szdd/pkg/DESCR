SZDD is a weak LZSS compressor, which was used by Microsoft for many years
in their installation software - all those files with a letter taken from
the end of their extension, eg HELLO.EX_

This package includes szddexpand which will decompress szdd files.
Be careful, szddexpand overwrites the original compressed file.
Do like so: szddexpand HELLO.EX_ && mv HELLO.EX_ HELLO.EXE

SZDD was replaced with 'KWAJ' in the 1996 Microsoft Setup Toolkit.  This
package does not grok the undocumented 'KWAJ' format.

One day Johnathan Forbes decided to work for Microsoft, and sold them his
LZX compression technology.  So now Microsoft uses LZX compression in their
installation archives, under the guise of "CAB" files.
