The idea behind parchive is to provide a tool to apply the data-recovery
capability concepts of RAID-like systems to the posting and recovery of 
multi-part archives on Usenet. Current filespec and clients support the
'Reed-Soloman Code' implementation that allows for recovery of any 'X' 
volumes for 'X' parity volumes present. 

The key to this mission is a clean file format specification which provides 
all the necessary capabilities for programs to easily verify and regenerate 
single missing parts out of a set of archives.
