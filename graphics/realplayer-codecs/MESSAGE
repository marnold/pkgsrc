This package requires a special hack to run on PowerPC systems, and to
enable one codec on all systems.

For PowerPC, these shared libraries are linked agained glibc6, the need a
"libc.so.6" file.  Fortunately, only a few simple functions (malloc, free,
memset, memcpy) are needed and these work from the NetBSD libc.  As root,
you need to run this command to complete this installation (this *is*
ugly, but for now it is our best solution):

	# cd /usr/lib
	# ln -s libc.so libc.so.6

For all systems, to use the "sipr" codec, a "libm.so.6" is required.  It
is not yet known if the NetBSD libm will suit this functionality or not.
