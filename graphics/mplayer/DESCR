MPlayer is a movie player for UNIX. It plays most MPEG, AVI and ASF files,
supported by many native and Win32 DLL codecs. You can watch VCD, DVD and even
DivX movies too. The another big feature of mplayer is the wide range of
supported output drivers. It works with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev,
but you can use SDL (and this way all drivers of SDL, for example AAlib) and
some lowlevel card-specific drivers (for Matrox) too! Most of them supports
software or hardware scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen. And what
about the nice big antialiased shaded subtitles (7 supported types!!!) with
hungarian, english, cyrillic, czech, korean fonts, and OSD?
