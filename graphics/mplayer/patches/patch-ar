-/// Replacement of dct36() with AMD's 3DNowEx(DSP)! SIMD operations support
-///
-/// This code based 'dct36_3dnow.s' by Syuuhei Kashiyama
-/// <squash@mb.kcom.ne.jp>,only some types of changes have been made:
-///
-///  - added new opcode PSWAPD
-///  - change function name for support 3DNowEx! automatic detect
-///
-/// note: because K7 processors are an aggresive out-of-order three-way
-///       superscalar ones instruction order is not significand for them.
