Avidemux is a graphical tool to edit video.  It can open AVI, MPEG, Nuppelvideo
and BMPs.  Most common codecs are supported (M-JPEG, MPEG, DivX, Xvid, huffyuv,
WMA, etc.) thanks to libavcodec.  Video can be edited, cut, appended, filtered
(resize/crop/denoise), and re-encoded to either AVI (DivX/Xvid) or MPEG 1/2. 

Note that this package does not support DivX.
