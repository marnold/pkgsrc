This project is building a hardware accelerated glx module for free unix
operating systems. Currently, we have support for 3D acceleration on the
Matrox MGA-G200, MGA-G400, and nvidia's RIVA series for XFree86 3.3. We
also support software rendering. 

The GLX protocol is a way to send 3D graphics commands over an
X client-server connection. It was created by Silicon Graphics and
recently released as open source. We're currently based on a separate
implementation, however.
