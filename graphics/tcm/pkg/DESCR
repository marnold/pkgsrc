TCM is a collection of graphical editors for different software
specification methods. It contains generic editors (for generic
diagrams, tables and trees), editors for Structured Analysis
(entity-relationship diagrams, data and event flow diagrams,
state-transition diagrams, function refinement trees etc.) and editors
for UML (static-structure diagrams, use-case diagrams, activity
diagrams etc.).

TCM supports constraint checking for single documents (e.g. name
duplication and cycles in is-a relationships). TCM distinguishes
built-in constraints (of which a violation cannot even be attempted)
from immediate constraints (of which an attempted violation is
immediately prevented) and soft constraints (against which the editor
provides a warning when it checks the drawing). TCM is planned to
support hierarchic graphs, so that it can handle, for example,
hierarchic statecharts. Features to be added later include constraint
checking across documents and executable models.

In addition to the TCM file format, TCM outputs Plain PostScript,
Encapsulated PostScript, PNG and the XFig file format. The TCM file
format is simple to read and parse so other forms of output can be
generated easily.
