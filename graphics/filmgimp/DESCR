Film Gimp is an image retouching and painting tool with features similar to
GIMP and Adobe Photoshop, and is recognized as a tool for motion picture
artists; however, anyone who wants to retouch or paint images can use Film
Gimp.  The primary feature of Film Gimp is its vast dynamic range: 16-bits
per channel (64-bit RGBA).  The extended dynamic range of Film Gimp appeals
not just to 35mm cinematographers, but to 35mm still photographers as well.
Still photographers can think of Film Gimp as having many more F-stops of
range, of being capable of capturing much more subtle nuances of color in
a vast blue sky for instance. Film Gimp handles 8-bit, 16-bit linear, and
16-bit float images.
