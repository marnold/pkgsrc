"Tux Paint" is a drawing program for young children. It provides
a simple interface and fixed canvas size, and will provide access
to previous images using a thumbnail browser (e.g., no access to
the underlying filesystem).

Unlike popular drawing programs like "The GIMP," it has a very
limited toolset. However, it provides a much simpler interface,
and has entertaining, child-oriented additions such as sound effects.
