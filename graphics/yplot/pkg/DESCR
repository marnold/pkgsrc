YPLOT is a program which combines the power of the Yorick programming
language with the graphical capabilities of PLPlot. With YPLOT it is
possible to create plots of both draft and publication quality very
quickly and efficiently.

YPLOT can do linear plots, log-log plots (with any variations of log
and linear axes possible), 3D surface and mesh plots (there is a
difference, really ;-), 3D line and scatter plots, grid lines, with
lots of symbols and stroked fonts to choose from (all scalable).
YPLOT gives the user full control over boxes drawn, captions, fonts
and placement of labels.

Plotting with YPLOT is fast due to the interpreted nature of YPLOT
(which means decreased development time), and the efficiency of Yorick.

Lots of output devices are available, including X11, Postscript,
Laserjet printers, and PLPlot metafiles for later rendering.

The packages also includes a tutorial and reference manual that
demonstrates most of YPLOT's capabilities with explanations every step
of the way!
