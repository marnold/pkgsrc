libwmf is a library for unix like machines that can convert wmf
(Windows Meta Files) files into other formats.  Currently it supports
a gd binding to convert to png, and an X one to draw direct to an X
window or pixmap. It also comes with a program to display wmfs: xwmf.

Without a truetype font server and the standard windows fonts the X
binding might render text in a different font than would appear under
windows natively (this is a runtime issue for the xwmf program).
