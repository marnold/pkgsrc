  The FreeType project develops free, portable and high-quality software
solutions for digital typography.  FreeType 1.3.1 was the last release of
the FreeType 1 engine, as the project is now switching to a new version
dubbed FreeType 2.  It has, among other things, several advantages among
FreeType 1:

 * A universal and simple API to manage font files
 * Support for several font formats through loadable drivers
 * Even more portable
 * An improved anti-aliased algorithm
