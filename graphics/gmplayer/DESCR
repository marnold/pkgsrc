MPlayer is a movie player for LINUX (though it runs on most Unices,
and even on non-x86 architectures). It plays most MPEG, AVI and
ASF files (also some QT/MOV files, with CVID, VP31 video, and raw
audio), supported by many native and win32 DLL codecs. You can
watch VCD, DVD and even DivX movies too. The another big feature
of mplayer is the wide range of supported output drivers. It works
with X11, Xv, DGA, OpenGL, SVGAlib, fbdev, but you can use SDL (and
this way all drivers of SDL) and some lowlevel card-specific drivers
(for Matrox/3dfx/SiS) too! Most of them supports software or hardware
scaling, so you can enjoy movies in fullscreen. And what about the
nice big antialiased shaded subtitles (9 supported types!!!) with
european/ISO 8859-1,2 (hungarian, english, czech, etc), cyrillic,
korean fonts, and OSD...
