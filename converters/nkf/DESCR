Nkf is a yet another kanji code converter between the different types
of kanji codes out there.  It can convert between 7-bit JIS, MS-kanji
(shifted-JIS) or EUC.

One of the most unique facilities of nkf is that it guesses the input
kanji code. It currently recognizes 7-bit JIS, MS-kanji (shifted-JIS)
and EUC.  So users don't need to specify (or even know) the input
kanji code type.
