Samba is a suite of programs which work together to allow clients to access to
a server's filespace and printers via the SMB (Server Message Block) protocol.

In practice, this means that you can redirect disks and printers to Unix disks
and printers from Lan Manager clients, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 clients,
Windows NT clients, Linux clients and OS/2 clients.  There is also a generic
Unix client program supplied as part of the suite which allows Unix users to
use an ftp-like interface to access filespace and printers on any other SMB
servers.  This gives the capability for these operating systems to behave much
like a LAN Server or Windows NT Server machine, only with added functionality
and flexibility designed to make life easier for administrators.

                    *===* Security Notes *===*

The users' encrypted passwords stored in ${ETCDIR}/private/smbpasswd (default:
/etc/samba/private/smbpasswd) *ARE PASSWORD EQUIVALENT* from the viewpoint of
SMB protocol.  Do not weaken the permission mode of this file (default:
root.wheel and rw-------) without any special reasons.  And please note that
even if you pkg_delete this port, pkg_delete will *NOT* remove the smbpasswd
file because pkg_delete can be used for upgrading this package.  If you won't
use this package anymore, I strongly recommend that you remove the smbpasswd
file manually.
