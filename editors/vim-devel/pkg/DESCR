Beta test version of the Vi IMproved 6 text editor. There are quite a
lot of changes to version 5, such as:

                     Folding - momentarily hide part of the text
    Vertically split windows - mixed with horizontal splits     
                   Diff mode - show and remove differences between files     
    Easy Vim: click-and-type - for those who really don't like two modes     
                 User manual - learn to use Vim, reads like a book           
          Flexible indenting - automatic indenting for any language          
    Extended search patterns - more regexp power than you will need          
               UTF-8 support - Unicode allows editing nearly all languages   
      Multi-language support - translated messages and menus   
              Plugin support - drop a script in a directory and you can use it
            Filetype plugins - an easy way to setup for editing a type of file

  Cursor in virtual position - edit tables and draw ASCII pictures           
          Debugger interface - use Vim with Sun Visual Workshop              
  Communication between Vims - let one Vim tell another Vim what to do       
                    Printing - print with syntax colors (MS-Windows only)    
           Quickfix extended - see error messages in a window and jump there 
      Writing files improved - rename or copy to make a backup file 
               Argument list - select groups of files to work on    
              Restore a View - save the looks of a window and restore it later
               Color schemes - quickly switch between different color setups
