The editor 'ee' (easy editor) is intended to be a simple, easy to use
terminal-based screen oriented editor that requires no instruction to
use.  Its primary use would be for people who are new to computers, or who
use computers only for things like e-mail.

ee's simplified interface is highlighted by the use of pop-up menus which
make it possible for users to carry out tasks without the need to
remember commands.  An information window at the top of the screen shows
the user the operations available with control-keys.

ee allows users to use full eight-bit characters.  If the host system has
the capabilities, ee can use message catalogs, which would allow users to
translate the message catalog into other languages which use eight-bit
characters.  See the file ee.i18n.guide for more details.

ee relies on the virtual memory abilities of the platform it is running on
and does not have its own memory management capabilities.
