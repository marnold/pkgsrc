gnotepad+ is an easy-to-use, yet fairly feature-rich, simple HTML and text 
editor for Unix based systems running X11 and using GTK (the Gimp ToolKit) 
and/or GNOME. gnotepad+ was designed to have as little bloat as possible, 
while still providing many of the common features found in a modern 
GUI-based text editor.  It is still fairly light-weight, especially for 
the features it offers, and aims to remain that way.
