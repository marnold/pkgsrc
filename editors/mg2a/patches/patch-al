+Modified by John P. Refling, Dec 1999.  This is version 1.00 of the
+mods.  Basically consists of the port to NetBSD and a change to the
+mg.rc startup file name and search paths. 
+
+Version 1.10 (Jan 2000) added journaling and the inital mirroring
+of files: 
+
+Journaling
+~~~~~~~~~~
+
+if a subdirectory named .journal exists in the directory of a
+previously existing edited file, the edited file is copied into the
+.journal subdirectory before the new version is written out.  The
+filename of the file in the journal subdirectory is appended with a
+-@# where # is the system time in seconds since January 1, 1970.
+
+This feature creates an automatic invisible backup chain of all files
+edited within a selected directory.
+
+state of selected files, before any editing.
+
+selective initial mirroring
+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+
+if a subdirectory named .original exists in the directory of a
+previously existing edited file, and a copy of the editied file
+does not exist there, then the edited file is copied into the .original
+subdirectory before the new version is written out.
+This feature provides automatic invisible backups of the original
+state of selected files, before any editing.  Useful for keeping
+track of the original contents of distributed configuration files.
+Files in the .original subdirectory with non-zero size indicate that
+the corresponding file has been modified.
+
+If the environment variable MG_DOT_ORIG is set, then the edited
+file is copied to a .orig file, if the .orig file does not exist.
+Helpful for creating diffs.
