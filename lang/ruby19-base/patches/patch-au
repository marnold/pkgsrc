Defer loading readline, when it is really needed.
Some unknown reason:

1. build devel/ruby-readline with editline(3).
2. Execute a ruby script loading readline in background from shell.
3. When the script output something to stdout, it got SIGTSTP and suspends.

There is no such problem when build devel/ruby-readline with GNU's readline.
