From the distribution README:

Perl is a language that combines some of the features of C, sed, awk
and shell.  See the manual page for more hype.  There are also two Nutshell
Handbooks published by O'Reilly & Assoc.  See pod/perlbook.pod
for more information.

This package installs libperl as a shared object so that it can be linked
with minimal executable overhead, or can be dlopen()ed.
