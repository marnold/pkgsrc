OpenC++ is a version of C++ with a Metaobject Protocol. In other
words, it is a tool of source-code translation for C++. Programmers
can easily implement various kinds of translation so that they can
define new syntax, new annotation, and new object behavior. OpenC++ is
useful if they need, for example: developing extensions to C++, to
provide support for things like parallelism, distribution,
concurrency, and persistence; Adding domain-, application-, or
class-specific compiler optimizations; Building their own version of
(runtime) MOP for C++.
