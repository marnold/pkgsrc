  Gb is an embryonic attempt to provide VB compatible functionality for the
GNOME project, particularly with respect to office (VBA) compatibility.  It is
part of the GNOME desktop environment: a project to create a free, user
friendly desktop environment.  As every other component of GNOME, Gnome Basic
is free software  (Some other people like to call this OpenSource software)
and it is licensed under the terms of the GNU GPL.
