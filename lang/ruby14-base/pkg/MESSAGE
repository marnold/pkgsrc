Note that some stuff that comes with the standard Ruby 1.4
distribution is provided as separate ports:

	databases/ruby-gdbm:		GDBM module
	security/ruby-md5:		MD5 module
	devel/ruby14-readline:		readline module
	x11/ruby-tcltklib		Tcl/Tk libraries
	x11/ruby14-tk			Tk modules

They could install with ruby14 meta package.

To use other ruby-* package with Ruby 1.4, build and install them with
"RUBY_VER=1.4" defined (i.e. make RUBY_VER=1.4 install), although not
all packages can't be used.
