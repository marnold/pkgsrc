+NAME
+  f90    - Fortran 90 Compiler            
+           Fortran 90 to Fortran 77 Translator 
+           Version 3.4 M     (1.03.9) 
+
+USAGE
+  f90     [<f90_option>]... [<g77_option>]... 
+          [-Wv,<v_option>[,<v_option>]...] [files]
+
+DESCRIPTION
+  The f90 command compiles Fortran 90 files by invoking
+  the vf90 precompiler and the g77 Fortran compiler.
+
+  Most g77 compiler options are accepted by f90.
+  Options to vf90 may be passed using the -Wv "hand off" option. 
+
+  Input files for f90 may be one or more of the following: 
+
+  1. filename with a .f90 suffix: free format Fortran 90 source file.
+  2. filename with a .f suffix:   fixed format Fortran 90 source file.
+  3. filename with a .m suffix:   Fortran 90 module file.
+  4. filename with a .s suffix:   assembler source file.
+  5. filename with a .o suffix:   object file.
+  6. filename with a .a suffix:   archive file. 
+
+Options:
+  -c         suppress the link editing phase of the 
+             compilation and do not remove any object 
+             files produced.
+
+  -dryrun    display but do not execute f90 internal 
+             commands. f90 will still check for the 
+             existence of essential executable files.
+
+
+  -l<suffix> search the library file lib<suffix>.a.    
+
+  -L<dir>    search directory <dir> for libraries prior
+             to searching the default directories.
+
+  -o<name>   name the final output file <name>. When used
+             with -c, names the object file, otherwise 
+             names the link edited output file. (The 
+             default link edited output file is named 
+             a.out.) -o is ignored if the -vo option is
+             used.
+
+  -v         display f90 internal commands as execution
+             progresses.
+
+  -vo        execute vf90 pass only. Certain compiler options
+             included on the command line may be ignored.
+
+  -vn        execute g77 compiler only. vf90 options
+             included on the command line are ignored.
+             Note that the -vo and -vn options are 
+             mutually exclusive.
+
+  -w         suppress warning messages
+
+  -Wv        hand off arguments to pass vf90.  vf90 options 
+             must be separated by commas and may not 
+             contain embedded blank space characters. 
+             Examples:      
+                -Wv,-da     
+                -Wv,-e78,-da
+             The -o vf90 option may not be used. 
+
+  -Yvc,<path> substitute for g77 an alternate executable
+             whose pathname is specified by <path>.
+
+  -Yvv,<path> substitute for vf90 an alternate executable
+             whose pathname is specified by <path>.
+
+
+  <v_option> represents any vf90 option except the -o option.
+
+  <g77_option> represents any g77 compiler option except those
+             listed as unsupported. (See below.)
+
+
+  f90 options and input files may appear in any order.
+
+  For a detailed description of each option, please refer
+  to the vf90 User's Guide.
+
+EXAMPLES
+
+    f90 -c -Wv,-ya,-yb file1.f90 
+
+    Runs vf90 with free format input and free format output
+    disabled on file1.f90, compiles the intermediate 
+    file Vfile1.f, and produces the object file file1.o.
+    The linker is not invoked. Note that the .f90 
+    extension implies that the file is free format,
+    hence these flags are necessary if the code is in
+    fixed format.
+
+CAVEATS
+  Module files (files with .m extensions) should 
+  be specified on the f90 command line before
+  the Fortran 90 source file(s) which use them.
+
+  The following g77 options are not fully supported by f90:
+     -S 
+     -E 
+     -D 
+     -U 
+  
+  A warning or error message will be output whenever
+  an unsupported option is encountered.
+

+FILES
+  file.f90             free format Fortran 90 source
+                       file
+  file.f               fixed format Fortran 90 source
+                       file
+  file.m               Fortran 90 module file
+  file.o               object file
+  file.s               assembly language file
+  Vfile.f              intermediate file produced after 
+                       pass vf90. Contains preprocessed 
+                       Fortran 77 source code. 
+  a.out                link edited output file
+  TMPDIR/*             temporary files
+  BINDIR/g77           Fortran 77 compiler
+  BINDIR/ld            link editor
+
+  Executable files corresponding to g77 passes
+  are not listed nor are the intermediate files
+  produced by g77.
+
+WARNINGS
+  Use of the -Yvc,<path>  and -Yvv,<path> options will 
+  disable most of the command line argument error checks  
+  performed by f90.
