Wonka is ACUNIA's cleanroom Virtual Machine for the Java(tm) language. 
It is extremely portable and self-contained, and can optionally be
used with its own real-time executive (OSwaldTM) to provide a complete
solution for embedded devices.  It is a full implementation of the
Java language, not just a subset.  And it's Open Source.
