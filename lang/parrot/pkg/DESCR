PARROT: A bytecode language possible to be used in the future by 
Perl 6 and a Python.

The idea was originally an April fool's joke...

"What we're releasing today is a very, very early alpha of the Parrot
interpreter.  At the moment, we have support for some simple
operations on integer, floating point and string registers, and the
ability to read in and execute bytecode.  We also have an assembler
which can generate bytecode output from Parrot assembly."
