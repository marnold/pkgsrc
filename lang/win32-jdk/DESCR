This package is a wrapper around the standard Win32 Java(tm) 2 Development
Kit (or optionally the Java(tm) 2 Runtime Environment, if no development
tools are needed).  This package will install correctly whether or not there
is a working JDK/JRE on the system; it is up to the user to make sure it
is correctly installed on the Win32 side.

This package will attempt path conversion, but it is simplistic and flimsy.
This support will be improved in future package versions.
