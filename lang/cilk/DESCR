Cilk is a language for multithreaded parallel programming based on
ANSI C.  Cilk is designed for general-purpose parallel programming,
but it is especially effective for exploiting dynamic, highly
asynchronous parallelism, which can be difficult to write in
data-parallel or message-passing style.  Cilk has been developed since
1994 by the Supercomputing Technologies Group at the MIT Laboratory
for Computer Science.  Cilk has been used for research, teaching, and
for coding applications such as a virus shell assembly simulator and
three chess programs.
