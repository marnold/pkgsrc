This is a plugin for gkrellm that simply prints the current clock
speed for users that own speed stepping processors.  It works on
normal non-stepping processors also, but there isn't really any point
in measuring the clock if it is the same every time you measure it, is
there?  Included code from x86info to calculate an estimate clock
speed.
