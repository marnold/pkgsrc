.Sh NAME
.Nm mklivecd
.Nd build a
.Nx
Live CD for i386 machines
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar target
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows you to build your own
.Nx
Live CD, so you don't need to install
.Nx
to any disk, because it will run directly from the CD-ROM.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
.Nm
reads the parameters of the main configuration file
stored inside
.Pa $HOME/.mklivecd/mklivecd.conf ,
so be sure you have modified it with your
preferences before starting any target.
.Pp
Configuration files are simple shell scripts that define
variables.
The default values shown here are those written in the template when
issuing the
.Ar config
target.
.Bl -tag -width 15n -offset indent
.It SOURCEDIR
The
.Nx
source directory.
Defaults to
.Pa /usr/src .
.It PKGSRCDIR
The
.Nx
packages collection directory.
When the
.Ar chroot
target is invoked, the pkgsrc directory will be mounted via
.Xr mount_null 8 ,
and you could install any package.
Defaults to
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
.It SHAREDIR
The main directory used to store the Makefiles, kernel, example configuration
files, etc.
Defaults to
.Pa $PREFIX/share/mklivecd/ .
.It BASEDIR
Primary directory used to store the main directories and the final ISO image.
Defaults to
.Pa $HOME/livecd .
.It WORKDIR
Directory used to store the object files and kernel built by the target
.Ql kernel .
Defaults to
.Pa $BASEDIR/work .
.It ISODIR
Directory used to store the main
.Nx
base distribution.
Defaults to
.Pa $BASEDIR/iso .
.It BASE_SETS_DIR
The base sets directory.
Defaults to
.Pa $HOME/release/binary/sets .
.It X11_SETS_DIR
The X11 sets directory.
Defaults to
.Pa $BASE_SETS_DIR .
.It BASE_SETS
Base sets which will be unpacked into
.Pa $ISODIR .
Sets used by default are:
.Pa etc.tgz base.tgz comp.tgz text.tgz .
.It X11_SETS
X11 sets which will be unpacked into
.Pa $ISODIR .
Sets used by default are:
.Pa xbase.tgz xcomp.tgz xfont.tgz xserver.tgz .
.It ENABLE_X11
If set to
.Sy yes
then X11 sets and configuration files will be unpacked automatically.
Defaults to
.Sy no .
.It BLANK_BEFORE_BURN
Used in the
.Ar burn
target to blank a CD-RW before burning the
.Nx
Live CD ISO image.
Useful if you use CD-RW.
Defaults to
.Sy no .
.It CDROM_DEVICE
Used in the target
.Ar burn
to specify the CD-ROM device.
Defaults to
.Sy 15,1,0 .
.It PERSONAL_CONFIG
If set to
.Sy yes ,
then
.Pa personal_config
file will be used.
See below for details.
Defaults to
.Sy no .
.It BOOTKERN
Name of the
.Nx
kernel used for the boot image.
Defaults to
.Sy KERN-LIVECD .
.It KERNEL_NAME
Name of the built
.Nx
kernel.
Useful if you want to change the default behaviour of the build process.
Defaults to
.Sy MKLIVECD .
.It IMAGE_NAME
Name of the final ISO image, e.g.:
.Pa My_NetBSD_Live_CD_ISO_Image.iso .
Defaults to
.Sy NetBSD-LiveCD .
.It PKG_SYSCONFDIR
Directory where the pkgsrc settings are stored, by default
.Nm
preserves this behaviour and uses
.Pa usr/pkg/etc .
.It REMOVE_DIRS
Take care with this option, because it will remove all directories when
the target
.Ar iso
is invoked.
It could be useful if you don't want to include some directories
on the CD, or your free space is small.
Defaults to
.Pa altroot rescue usr/share/info .
.It MNT_{MOUNT_POINT}_ARGS
This specifies the arguments passed to the
.Xr mount 8
command used in the
.Pa mfs_rcd
script, when the
.Nx
Live CD is booted.
You shouldn't add
.Sy swap
at the end, because it will be added automatically by
the script.
.El
.Sh TARGETS
A target specifies what
.Nm
should do (as in make).
The following list describes all supported targets,
in the logical order in which you should call them.
.Bl -tag -width 15n -offset indent
.It Ar config
Create a sample
.Pa mklivecd.conf
file.
You should edit it after the creation as you will probably want to
change the default configuration, especially paths.
.It Ar kernel
Builds the specified kernel
.Pa $BOOTKERN
into the
.Pa $ISODIR
directory.
.It Ar base
Install the
.Pa $BASE_SETS
and
.Pa $X11_SETS
into the
.Pa $ISODIR
directory and prepare the base system for the next target,
which is the most important:
.Ar chroot .
.It Ar chroot
Enters the chroot environment.
Uses
.Xr ksh 1
as default shell.
.It Ar iso
Builds the ISO image
.Pa $IMAGE_NAME
into
.Pa $BASEDIR
and removes all directories specified in
.Pa $REMOVE_DIRS
before it, to save some space.
.It Ar burn
Burns the ISO image
.Pa $IMAGE_NAME
on the CD-ROM with
.Xr cdrecord 1 .
Use the
.Pa $CDROM_DEVICE
variable to specify the default device.
.It Ar clean
Cleans the
.Pa $WORKDIR
directory and the base
.Nx
tree in
.Pa $ISODIR ,
except the CD-ROM boot image
.Pa /stand/cdlive-boot.fs
and the
.Nx
kernel
.Pa /netbsd .
.El
.Ss What should I do in the chroot jail?
While working in the chroot environment, you can
add users, install binary packages, modify
.Pa /etc/ttys ,
etc.
You can enter the chroot as often as you want,
.Nm
will create the tarballs automatically when you leave
the chroot.
.Ss How can I use the PERSONAL_CONFIG option?
When
.Ar PERSONAL_CONFIG
is set to
.Sy yes ,
.Pa $HOME/.mklivecd/personal_config
will be used.
For example, you can copy some configuration directories
from
.Ar $HOME
to the
.Ar $ISODIR/$HOME
directory.
Please take a look at the example file located in
.Ar ${PREFIX}/share/mklivecd .
.Sh NOTES
.Pa PKG_SYSCONFDIR
defaults to
.Ar usr/pkg/etc
without a starting slash.
This shouldn't be added because
.Nm
adds this automatically in the script, otherwise your real PKG_SYSCONFDIR
directory will be copied instead of the one located in
.Pa $ISODIR .
.Pp
An example kernel config file,
.Pa KERN-LIVECD ,
has been installed into
.Ar ${PREFIX}/share/mklivecd ,
based on the -current branch.
You should copy your own kernel config file into
.Ar $HOME/.mklivecd .
The
.Sy BOOTKERN
variable should point at it.
