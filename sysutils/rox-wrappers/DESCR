Here are some example wrapper applications for rox.

Click on them to run them. Note that you must have the full program
already installed - if you haven't got Netscape then the Netscape wrapper
won't work, etc!

You can drag these to your panel or pinboard to add them, and you can drag
files to them.

Some of these wrappers can run various different commands - for example,
Lock can either use xlock or xscreensaver.  To change the command used,
load the AppRun script in the Lock directory into Edit and move the hash 
(#) mark to the other line (lines beginning with # are ignored).
