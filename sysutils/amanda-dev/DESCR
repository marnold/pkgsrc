Amanda is a backup system designed to archive many computers on a network to a
single large-capacity tape drive.  This is a package of a developement
snapshot of the 2.4.3 branch.

This package does not contain anything by itself -- it is a
"meta-package" that depends on the amanda-client, amanda-server,
and amanda-plot packages.  Its purpose is to require dependencies
so users can install this package only and have the complete
Amanda software pulled in by the port/package dependency mechanism.
