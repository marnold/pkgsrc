  Medusa is software that allows you to quickly search your system for
particular types of files, using an index.

CAVEATS
-------

  Medusa is still in its early stages.  It is not yet feature complete,
and there are known bugs, some of which can take up lots of
unnecessary resources on your machine.

  Please do not use this code on an afs system or over nfs volumes;
the file permissions are not compatible with medusa.  Running
medusa on these systems is completely insecure.
