You can set the LIBDIRPATH variable to let other ROX applications
know where to find ROX-Lib. For example:

	setenv LIBDIRPATH ${PREFIX}/share/rox/ROX-Lib

You need to do this before you start the ROX-Filer. However, ROX 
applications installed from the NetBSD packages collection should find 
ROX-Lib correctly by default.
