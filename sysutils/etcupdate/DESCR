etcupdate helps you to update the configuration files in /etc after
performing an operating system upgrade.

The idea for this script (including code fragments, variable names etc.)
came from the FreeBSD mergemaster (by Douglas Barton). Unlike the FreeBSD
mergemaster, this does not use CVS version tags to compare if the files
need to be updated. Files are compared with /usr/bin/cmp as this is more
reliable and the only way if the version numbers are same even though the
files are different.
