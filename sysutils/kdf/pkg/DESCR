KDiskFree shows your harddisk-(floppy...)usage graphically and
lets you simply mount/umount devices by clicking on its name.
You can even configure a special mount/umount command for each device.
Also a filemanager is opened if you click on the mountpoint.
It is linked into the KControlCenter in the category "information"
but also under the start-menu hierarchy [System].
You also may start it simply by typing kdf.
KwikDisk docks into the KPanel and gives you quick access to
mount/umount your devices.
