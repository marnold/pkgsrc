These tools allow you to access Macintosh disks without mounting
them. You can copy from or to BSD files, list directories, or run
various other file / directory modification commands. The command
naming is similar to that used by the mtools command (which is
similar to MS-DOS command names), except that the names begin with
an 'h'.
