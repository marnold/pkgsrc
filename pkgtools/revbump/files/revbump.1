.Sh NAME
.Nm revbump
.Nd tool to help bump PKGREVISIONs automatically
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl p Ar pkgsrcdir
.Op cat1/pkg1 ... catN/pkgN
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a perl script for pkgsrc developers that simplifies bumping
PKGREVISIONs automatically.
Given a package (in
.Ar category/package
format) on the command line or stdin, it will try to increase
the PKGREVISION for that package automatically.
If
.Fl p
is given,
.Ar pkgsrcdir
is used instead of the default
.Pa /usr/pkgsrc .
.Nm
reports successful updates on stdout, and prints the package name
(in
.Ar category/package
form) on stdout for each package where it failed.
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Dl revbump devel/gmake x11/glib2
.Pp
would bump the PKGREVISIONs of gmake and glib2, as would
.Bd -literal -offset indent
revbump << EOF
devel/gmake
x11/glib2
EOF
.Ed
.Pp
The complete procedure for a recursive dependency bump for
the openssl package using
.Nm
and
.Xr blbump 1
would be:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
cd /usr/pkgsrc
cvs update
make index
make show-deps PKG=openssl > deps
revbump < deps > deps.manual
[handle the PKGREVISION bumps in deps.manual manually]
blbump < deps > deps.manual
[handle the *RECOMMENDED* bumps in deps.manual manually]
cvs diff
[look for PYPKGPREFIX -> py22 or py23pth expansions
 in buildlink files and any unrelated diffs you have in your
 local tree, and fix them]
lintpkgsrc -d > deps.manual
[fix broken dependencies noted by this (usually meta-pkg/kde3,
  subversion, nessus)]
cvs diff
cvs commit
