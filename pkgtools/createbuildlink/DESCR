This package installs a shell script that will take a Makefile
and a PLIST file of an existing package and create an initial
buildlink.mk file from it.  The script tries to interpret the
contents of the include and lib subdirectories (if any) of the
package and add the corresponding BUILDLINK files.  In addition
it tries to identify possible config scripts and create the
corresponding wrapper entries for them.
