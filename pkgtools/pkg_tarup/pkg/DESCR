Script to tar up an already instaled package.

Now my question is, how can we include this? I'd prefer to have it
available from pkg_admin, but that is C, and the other is a script -
rewrite in C?

The Script has still two problems, as the INSTALL and MTREE files are
removed after a pkg_add/make install. The INSTALL file isn't a problem to
keep, but the MTREE file will lead to a ~10% increase in space needed for
/var/db/pkg which I'm not sure we should do, esp. as the files are almost
always the same again. (On my notebook with ~250 installed pkgs, the size
increasement would be from 8.8MB to 10MB). 

Send your thoughts to me <hubertf@netbsd.org> !
