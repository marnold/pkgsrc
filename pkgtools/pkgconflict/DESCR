pkgconflict is a script that searches for conflicting packages.

In a first step it gathers the package and file names of all known
packages.  The source for this step is either the contents of
/var/db/pkg, or a directory where the builk builds saved the
package databases.

In a second step, it calls a database system, PostgreSQL, to
determine which packages have common file names. Packages with
registered CONFLICT lines are filtered out.
