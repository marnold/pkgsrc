cdpack is a small utility for creating ISO 9660 images for
a multi-CD binary package collection.  The utility creates
ISO 9660 images for all the binary packages in a specified
directory.  A choice of two algorithms is available for how
the packages are grouped.  The "no duplication" algorithm
arranges the packages so any package on CD number `n' will
have all of its dependencies on CD numbers 1 through `n'.
The "no inter-CD depends" algorithm will place certain
packages on more than one CD to ensure that each CD is self
contained (all package dependencies are satisfied within 
the single CD).
