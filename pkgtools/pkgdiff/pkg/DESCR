This package contains three tools to ease creating and maintaining
patches for pkgsrc: mkpatches, patchdiff, and pkgdiff.

pkgdiff compares two files (like diff) and produces an output file
that can be used in pkgsrc.

mkpatches automatically generates a set of patches, if the original
versions of the files had been saved as filename.orig.

patchdiff compares a previously existing set of patches with another
one created by mkpatches, and outputs any changes.
