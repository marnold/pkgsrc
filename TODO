package update TODO (Suggested package updates)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
	o update print/ghostscript to 6.53 when it is released, which will
	  have the gs-cjk changes as part of the main distribution. [jlam]

	o update automake to 1.5


pksgrc TODO (Suggested pkgsrc features and enhancements)
^^^^^^^^^^^

	o Add a default test target to mk/*.mk and override it in any pkgs
	  that have testsuites. Use it in bulk builds/test.

	o Add a sort check to pkglint for PLISTs.

	o Make pkgsrc work under HP-UX. (10.20, I mean)  I (IMHO) finished the
	  modifications for bsd.pkg.mk and will commit them after freeze.  The
	  remaining and harder part is to make the cross-environment for HP-UX.
