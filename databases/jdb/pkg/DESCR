JDB isa package of commands for manipulating flat-ASCII databases from
shell scripts.  JDB is useful to process medium amounts of data.  JDB is
very good at doing things like:

 * extracting measurements from experimental output
 * re-examining data to address different hypotheses
 * joining data from different experiments
 * computing statistics on data (mean, confidence intervals, histograms,
   correlations)
 * reformatting data for graphing programs
