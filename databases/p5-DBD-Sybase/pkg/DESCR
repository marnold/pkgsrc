  DBD::Sybase is built upon the DBI, the generic Perl Database
Interface.  It brings you an identical interface to a broad
variety of databases and is in this regard comparable to ODBC.
The advantage of the DBI approach is portability and
interoperability.

  The Sybase backend allows access to Sybase and Microsoft-SQL
servers.
