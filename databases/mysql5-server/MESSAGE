You can start the MySQL server doing the following steps:

$ echo "mysqld=yes" >> /etc/rc.conf # NetBSD or a system with rc.d

If you are using PKG_RCD_SCRIPTS=YES, try the following:

$ ${RCD_SCRIPTS_DIR}/mysqld start

Otherwise try:

$ ${LOCALBASE}/${RCD_SCRIPTS_EXAMPLEDIR}/mysqld start

After the tables are set up and the MySQL server is running,
please remember to set a password for the MySQL root user!
This is done by running both:

  ${PREFIX}/bin/mysqladmin -u root -p password 'new-password'
  ${PREFIX}/bin/mysqladmin -h `hostname` -u root -p password 'new-password'

The "Enter password:" prompt is asking for the existing password.
As there is no existing password, just press the Return key.

There is a script distributed with MySQL that can help you lock down
an installation.  This script has been installed to

  ${PREFIX}/bin/mysql_secure_installation.

Please see the manual and the MySQL web site for more instructions.
