  This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both traditional
and object-oriented i/o) on things *other* than normal filehandles; in
particular, IO::Scalar, IO::ScalarArray, and IO::Lines.

  If you have access to tie(), these classes will make use of the
IO::WrapTie module to inherit a convenient new_tie() constructor.
It also exports a nice wraptie() function.

  In the more-traditional IO::Handle front, we have IO::AtomicFile which
may be used to painlessly create files which are updated atomically.

  And in the "this-may-prove-useful" corner, we have IO::Wrap, whose
exported wraphandle() function will clothe anything that's not a blessed
object in an IO::Handle-like wrapper... so you can just use OO syntax and
stop worrying about whether your function's caller handed you a string, a
globref, or a FileHandle.
