	Given a list of scalars or reference variables, writes out
	their contents in perl syntax. The references can also be
	objects.  The contents of each variable is output in a
	single Perl statement.  The return value can be evaled to
	get back the original reference structure. Bear in mind
	that a reference so created will not preserve pointer equalities 
	with the original reference.
