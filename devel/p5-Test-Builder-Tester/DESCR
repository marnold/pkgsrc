This perl5 module permits helps test testing modules that are built
with Test::Builder.
The testing system is designed to be used by performing a three
step process for each test you wish to test. This process starts
with using test_out and test_err in advance to declare what the
testsuite you are testing will output with Test::Builder to stdout
and stderr.
You then can run the test(s) from your test suite that call
Test::Builder. At this point the output of Test::Builder is safely
captured by Test::Builder::Tester rather than being interpreted as
real test output.
The final stage is to call test_test that will simply compare what
you predeclared to what Test::Builder actually outputted, and report
the results back with a "ok" or "not ok" (with debugging) to the
normal output.
