fastdep is a fast dependency generator for C/C++ files.  It generates a
file ready to be parsed by the make(1) utility containing dependancy
specifications for all source files given to it.

The program is written in C++ with a handoptimized parser for just the
preproccesor tokens; therefore it is faster than GCC because it does
just one thing.
