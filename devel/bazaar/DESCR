Bazaar gives you fast, distributed revision control that "Just Works",
supporting renames of files and directories smoothly.  Bazaar is
designed to maximise the level of community participation in your
project.

Bazaar branches can be published on any web server, and uploaded over
sftp, ftp, or rsync.  If you want the fastest possible network
performance, there is a smart server.  Bazaar supports flexible work
models:  centralized like cvs or svn, commit offline, enforced code
review when desired, and automatic regression testing.  Decentralized
revision control systems give people the ability to collaborate more
efficiently over the internet using the bazaar development model.
When you use Bazaar, you can commit to your own local branches of your
favourite free software projects without needing special permission.
