  OAF is the new object activation framework for GNOME.  Since many GNOME
applications utilize CORBA, a framework for locating and activating these
applications is necessary.  OAF, the Object Activation Framework, provides a
simple method for finding and running the CORBA objects available on a computer
system.

  Distributed operation is supported, allowing activation of objects on a
network of computers being used in a GNOME desktop.  The flexibility of OAF
enables it to be used outside of GNOME programs, allowing non-GNOME CORBA
applications to be utilized alongside GNOME applications.
