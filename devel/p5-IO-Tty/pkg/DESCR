IO::Tty and IO::Pty provide an interface to pseudo tty's

To build this distribution run

  perl Makefile.PL
  make
  make install

There is no make test for this distribution as it is hard to automate.
But they is a script included calle try.

If try is run with arguments it will run then as a command with the
output connected via a pseudo tty, eg

   perl -Mblib try ls

If run without arguments it should output something like

io_pty_ttyname/dev/ttya0
master IO::Pty=GLOB(0x81a8d40) *Symbol::GEN0 /dev/ttya0
slave  IO::Tty=GLOB(0x81a4d34) *Symbol::GEN1 /dev/ttya0
