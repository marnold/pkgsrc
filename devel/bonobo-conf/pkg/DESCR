  The Bonobo Configuration System (BCS) consists of several parts.   An
API to access configuration data, a database to store configuration values
in XML format and a system to visualise and edit configuration data.  The
whole system is built on top of bonobo and ORBit (CORBA).

  There are several APIs to access the configuration data, and the API can
be chosen through the bonobo moniker system.  It is up to the programmer
to decide which interface is best for a given application.  The
configuration system allows you to store the data with various backends.
Although BCS is shipped with it's own XML based backend, it is also
possible to use GConf, or LDAP as backend.  The configuration database
architecture is a reimplementation of the GConf architecture developed by
Havoc Pennington using Bonobo-native idioms.
