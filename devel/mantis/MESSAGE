To complete the setup you will need to read the INSTALL guide in order
to setup mySQL properly.  In particular secion 3 of the document deals
with database setup.  

You will need to make Mantis accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache then you may add the following lines to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/httpd/mantis.conf

to make Mantis accessible through:
	
	http://www.domain.com/mantis/index.php

You can also use the following URL to check your installation:
	
	http://www.domain.com/mantis/admin/index.php

IMPORTANT SECURITY NOTES:

	* Change your database password from the default and update your
	  config_inc.php to reflect the new password.
	* Once Mantis is running correctly remove the admin directory.
