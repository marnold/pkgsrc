The philosophy behind CWEB is that programmers who want to provide the
best possible documentation for their programs need two things
simultaneously: a language like TeX for formatting, and a language
like C for programming. Neither type of language can provide the best
documentation by itself. But when both are appropriately combined, we
obtain a system that is much more useful than either language
separately.
