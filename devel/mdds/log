mdds 0.5.1

  * fixed build issues on Windows, using MSVC compilers.

mdds 0.5.0

  * flat_segment_tree's search methods now return a std::pair of 
    const_iterator and bool, instead of just returning bool.  

  * fixed a weird enum value mis-handling with mixed_type_matrix when 
    compiled with MSVC++.

  * added new insert() method to flat_segment_tree that takes a 
    positional hint to boost insertion speed.  Also, all three 
    insert() methods now return the start position of the segment that 
    an inserted segment belongs to.  

  * slight performance improvement on the insert methods.

  * slight performance improvement on the iterators of 
    flat_segment_tree.

  * re-organized the structure of flat_segment_tree to split it into 
    multiple headers.  

  * properly support prefix, docdir, includedir configure options.
  
  * support DESTDIR environment variable for make install.
