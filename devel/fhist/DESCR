The FHist package contains 3 utilities, a file history tool ``fhist'',
a file comparison tool ``fcomp'', and a file merging tool ``fmerge'.
All three are bundled together, because they all use the same algorithm.

fhist

    Keeps track of versions of a file.  It works correctly when given
    binary files as input.  See fhist(1) for more information.

fcomp

    Compares two versions of a file, usually line-for- line textual
    comparison.  It is capable of comparing two binary files byte-for-byte.
    See fcomp(1) for more information.

fmerge

    Merges together edits from two descendants of a file.  See fmerge(1)
    for more information.

The history tool presented here, fhist, is a minimal history tool.
It provides no locking or branching.  This can be useful in contexts
where the configuration management or change control be being
provided by some other tool.
