This is Chris Provenzano's MIT Pthreads library.

Pthreads stands for POSIX threads and is based on the POSIX 1003.1c 1995 
thread standard. This standard passed international Standards Organization 
(ISO) Committee Document (CD) balloting in February 1995 and got the 
IEEE Standards Board approval in June 1995.
