This project is Intel Lab's software reference implementation of
iSCSI.  It has been tested to interoperate with the Cisco initiator,
and conforms to RFC 3720.

There are 3 forms of the iSCSI target that are produced:

	ufsdisk - standard iSCSI target
	ufsdisk_mmap - an mmap(2)-based iSCSI target
	uramdisk - a ramdisk iSCSI target

and a testing-quality user-level iSCSI initiator called utest, which
can exercise the targets above.
