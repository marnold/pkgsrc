  Bonobo-activation is the new Object Activation Framework for GNOME2.
It has a similar purpose to gnorba, the GNOME 1.x CORBA activation library,
and will replace it for GNOME 2.0.

  It allows you to do much more powerful activation queries than gnorba.
Each server is described by an XML file that defines its attributes.
When querying or activating, one may specify complex requirements using
the bonobo-activation query language.
