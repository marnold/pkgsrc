PyChecker is a tool for finding bugs in python source code. It finds
problems that are typically caught by a compiler for less dynamic
languages, like C and C++.  It is similar to lint. Because of the
dynamic nature of python, some warnings may be incorrect; however,
spurious warnings should be fairly infrequent.
