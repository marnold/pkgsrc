PTH is a very portable POSIX/ANSI-C based library for Unix platforms which 
provides non-preemptive scheduling for multiple threads of execution 
("multithreading") inside server applications. All threads run in the same 
address space of the server application, but each thread has it's own 
individual program-counter, run-time stack, signal mask and errno variable.
