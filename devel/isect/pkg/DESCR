isectd is an open-source middleware daemon that simplifies the
implementation of distributed processing and client-server systems.
Using a familiar file IO-like programmer's interface it makes
multi-tier programming as easy as reading and writing. 

Isect is short for intersect, a kind of table required in relational
databases to express many-to-many relationships. Distributed processing
implements process-oriented many-to-many relationships: many clients
communicating with many services. If it's mathmatically required for
data relationships then it's mathmatically required for process
relationships! This is the proof--and the reason you need isectd.
