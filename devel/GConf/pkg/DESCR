  GConf is a configuration database system, functionally similar to the
Windows registry but lots better. :-)  It's being written for the GNOME
desktop.

  GCONF IS SO INCREDIBLY ALPHA. AS IN, THERE ARE MORE UNTESTED CODE PATHS
THAN TESTED ONES.  However, it "theoretically" works and I'm interested in
people trying it out and looking for bugs.
