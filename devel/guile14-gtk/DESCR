  Guile-gtk is a library written to make GTK accessible from guile.
It provides a convenient interface for Scheme programmers to develop
visual applications.  It can also integrate with GNOME via the
Gnome-guile module.

  Guile-gtk was started by Marius Vollmer <mvo@zagadka.ping.de> and
is currently maintained by Ariel Rios <jarios@usa.net> and other
intrepid Guile hackers around the world.

Guile-gtk is free software licensed under the GPL.
