Provide keyboard shortcuts for X11R6, specifically intended for use with
the Blackbox window manager but usable with any.

Can bind actions such as executing commands, altering the states of windows,
switching workspaces, etc. to arbitrary keys.

Note: since the basic package does not install the qt-based configuration
tool, bbkeys ought to be invoked with the -noqt option unless you also
install the wm/bbkeys-qt package.
