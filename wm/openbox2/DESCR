Openbox is a window manager for the X11 windowing system.  It currently runs
on a large list of platforms.  It was originally based on Blackbox and
currently remains very similar, even using Blackbox styles (with available
extensions) for its themeing and is written entirely in C++ and maintains no
dependencies on any libraries other than X11.
