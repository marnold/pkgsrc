FIRST TIME USERS:
To use afterstep as your window manager, simply invoke "exec afterstep"
at the end of your .xinitrc (for "startx), or .xsession file (for xdm).
Don't forget to comment out any line(s) for your current window manager.

UPGRADERS:
Afterstep-1.8.x is more configurable than ever, but note: the format of
many of the configuration files has changed! In particular, it is no
longer necessary to maintain a complete copy of @PREFIX@/share/afterstep
in each home directory--your ~/Gnu/Library/Afterstep directory now need
only contain changes from the defaults in @PREFIX@/share/afterstep.
Upgraders are advised to back up their old ~/Gnu/Library/Afterstep directory,
and review the documentation before merging diffs carefully. 

EVERYBODY:
The AfterStep Control Panel for 1.8.x is still under development.
See the online docs--Wharf top button, or bottom item of start menu,
or view @PREFIX@/share/afterstep/doc/afterstep.html with any browser.
