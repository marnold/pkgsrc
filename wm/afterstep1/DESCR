AfterStep is a window manager for X which started by emulating the
NextStep look and feel, but which has evolved significantly from
its origins. It remains highly configurable, functional, and
intuitive. AfterStep was one of the first window managers to
achieve gnome compatibility, and it can be configured to complement
the Gnome Desktop very well.
