XMLTV is a set of utilities to manage your TV viewing. They work with TV 
listings stored in the XMLTV format, which is based on XML. The idea is to 
separate out the backend (getting the listings) from the frontend (displaying 
them for the user), and to implement useful operations like picking out your 
favourite programmes as filters that read and write XML documents. 

At present there are backends grabbing TV listings for Canada, the USA, the UK,
Germany, Austria, Finland, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands, Hungary, Denmark, 
Japan, Sweden, France, Norway, and Romania.
