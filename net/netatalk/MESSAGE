To have Netatalk start automatically at boot, copy (or link) the following
files into /etc/rc.d on rc.d-capable systems:
		${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/atalkd
		${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/afpd
		${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/papd
		${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/timelord

If you do so, you will need to set the following variables in /etc/rc.conf 
(replacing "YES" with "NO" for those services you wish to not run):
		atalkd=YES
		afpd=YES
		papd=YES
		timelord=YES

Example Netatalk config files have been installed in the examples directory
at ${PREFIX}/share/examples/netatalk. Production config files are
installed in ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}. If no config files existed before this
package was installed, default config files were copied in.
