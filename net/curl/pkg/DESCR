Curl is a tool for getting files with URL syntax, supporting FTP,
HTTP, HTTPS, GOPHER, TELNET, DICT, FILE and LDAP. Curl supports HTTP
POST, HTTP PUT, FTP uploading, HTTP form based upload, proxies,
cookies, user+password authentication and a busload of other useful
tricks.

The main use for curl is when you want to get or send files
automatically to or from a site using one of the supported protocols.

Curl is free and open software that compiles under just about any Unix
as well as win32 systems. It is a product of efforts from many
authors, with Daniel Stenberg being main author and project
maintainer.
