You may want to install the x11/p5-Tk and net/p5-SNMP packages to
use the tkmib application!

You may also want to install the net/scotty package to do network
monitoring.

Finally, a note from the maintainer:
 
   I'm asking (begging) people to send me a postcard of your home city,
   area, or country.  I intend to arrange them into a logo, take a
   picture of them all, and use the picture on the ucd-snmp web page.
   I've gotten a few already, but need a lot more to make the logo a
   decent size.  The first pass from the postcards people have sent me
   so far can be seen on the ucd-snmp web site, listed below.  If you
   wish to send a postcard, please send it to:
 
          Wes Hardaker
