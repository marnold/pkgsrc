Libnet is a collection of routines to help with the construction
and handling of network packets. It provides a portable framework
for low-level network packet shaping, handling and injection. Libnet
features portable packet creation interfaces at the IP layer and
link layer, as well as a host of supplementary and complementary
functionality. Using libnet, quick and simple packet assembly
applications can be whipped up with little effort. With a bit more
time, more complex programs can be written (Traceroute and ping
were easily rewritten using libnet and libpcap)
