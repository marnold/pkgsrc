This is a release of Alternate Queueing for BSD Unix.
The release has become fairly stable but still it is a research prototype.
So use it at your own risk!
All interfaces are likely to change in the future release.

The release includes:
	alternate queueing support for FreeBSD-2.2.[1256]R kernel.
	CBQ, WFQ, RED, and FIFOQ implementations
	tools for CBQ
	RSVP stubs for CBQ
	ECN (for IPv4) support in RED and TCP

but lacks some of necessary documentation and functions.  Some
functions are implemented poorly.
