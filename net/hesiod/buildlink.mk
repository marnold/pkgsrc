# This Makefile fragment is included by packages that use the Hesiod name 
# service library. 
#
# To use this Makefile fragment, simply:
#
# (1) Optionally define USE_HESIOD to force use of the hesiod library
#     included in this package.
# (2) Optionally define BUILDLINK_DEPENDS.hesiod to the dependency pattern
#     for the version of hesiod library desired.
# (3) Include this Makefile fragment in the package Makefile,
# (4) Add ${BUILDLINK_DIR}/include to the front of the C preprocessor's header
#     search path, and
# (5) Add ${BUILDLINK_DIR}/lib to the front of the linker's library search
#     path.
