Michael Neumann's xmlrpc4r module is an implementation of the 
XML-RPC protocol for Ruby.

It supports:
  * Introspection and MultiCall extensions
  * HTTP Basic Authentification and SSL (client-only)
  * Asynchronous RPCs and connection-alive
  * CGI, FastCGI, mod_ruby and standalone server

For test modules, you need to install ruby-runit package, too.
