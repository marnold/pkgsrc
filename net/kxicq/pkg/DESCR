kicq is an KDE/Qt based clone which very closely resembles Mirabilis
ICQ. This client allows you to send and recieve messages, search for
users and add them to your contact list, as well as configure it from
within the GUI. In addition to the other features it also implements
the user search function, and makes use of a preferences dialog, so
user info can be edited within the program itself. kicq is in the beta
stage and therefore does not have all of the features of ICQ.
