Kmap is a gui frontend to the popular portscanning utility nmap. Nmap
is a console application with a wide variety of powerful options, but
the sheer number of these options can make using nmap difficult. Thus,
kmap is targeted towards those that would like to use a powerful
scanner from time to time, without having to constantly check the man
page for help.
