RADIUS is a standard authentication protocol.  The Merit AAA Server is
an enhanced version which adds proxying using realms.  This package also
includes enhancements by MR.NET for supporting S/Key passwords, proxying
requests to an FTP server, restricting the number of simultaneous logins
for any given account, and for defaulting the authentication realm.
