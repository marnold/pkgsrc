===============================================================================
Arla now has been installed on your system.

The cache directory used by arla is @ARLA_CACHE@.
This directory should be on a local disk. You can change the location
of the cache directory by setting the ARLA_CACHE environment variable
(or by setting ARLA_CACHE in /etc/mk.conf) to the desired location prior
to building arla.

To complete the installation you'll have to configure arla.
Default configuration files are installed in @PREFIX@/etc.

At a minimum, to configure an arla client, copy
@PREFIX@/etc/{CellServDB,SuidCells,ThisCell,arla.conf}.default to
@PREFIX@/etc/{CellServDB,SuidCells,ThisCell,arla.conf} and customize them.
Also, start arlad from rc.local, using the script provided in
@PREFIX@/etc/rc.d/arlad.sh
