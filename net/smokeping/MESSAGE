Smokeping is now installed.
The documentation can be found at ${PREFIX}/share/doc/smokeping/

A sample config file can be found in:
	${PREFIX}/share/examples/smokeping/config.dist

Please copy it as ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/config and adjust it as needed.
You may also want to have a look at basepage.html and smokemail in
this directory.

Also, make sure that your web's server /cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi refers to
${PREFIX}/libexec/cgi-bin/smokeping.cgi, or copy the smokeping in your
web server's cgi space.

If upgrading from version 1.x there is detailed information on what has 
changed available on the smokeping homepage.
