BeroFTPD is a replacement ftp server for Un*x systems based on wu-ftpd.
In addition to wu-ftpd's features, BeroFTPD includes better support for
virtual hosts, the possibility to send an e-mail to the FTP administrator
when an anonymous user uploads a file, better support for on-the-fly 
[re]compression, support for upload/download ratios, include-directive
in ftpaccess, an internal ls command (optional, currently experimental),
the ability to run as standalone daemon, and support for Kerberos5 and
AFS authentication.
