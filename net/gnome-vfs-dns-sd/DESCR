GNOME VFS provides an abstraction layer of the file system; applications
use this layer to access many different protocols and simulate that they
are part of the local file system.

This package provides the dns-sd module for GNOME VFS, which allows it to
discover sftp, webdav, and ftp services advertised with multicast DNS.
