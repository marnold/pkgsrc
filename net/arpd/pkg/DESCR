Look in the sample arpd.conf file. You can only have one aprnet
for each interface, but as many nonet, dont and proxy as you want.
On startup arpd will try to open /usr/local/etc/arpd.conf . If you
want another config file, specify that as an argument to arpd.

If you have any questions/suggestions, don't hesitate to ask/tell
