Nmap is a utility for port scanning large networks, although it
works fine for single hosts. It supports many different scanning
techniques and has a number of performance and reliability features
such as dynamic delay time calculations, packet timeout and
retransmission, parallel port scanning, detection of down hosts
via parallel pings, and flexible target and port specification.
