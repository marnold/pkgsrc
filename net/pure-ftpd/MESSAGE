To use pure-ftpd, you will need to perform the following steps:

1. In case you don't have PKG_RCD_SCRIPTS set in your /etc/mk.conf, copy
   ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/pure_ftpd to /etc/rc.d/pure_ftpd and add

	pure_ftpd=YES

   to /etc/rc.conf. Other FTP servers should be disabled.

2. Stop any other running FTP server. Now start pure-ftpd by issuing the
   command

	/etc/rc.d/pure_ftpd start
