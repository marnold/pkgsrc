This release of the NTP Version 4 (NTPv4) daemon for Unix incorporates
new features and refinements to the NTP Version 3 (NTPv3) algorithms.
However, it continues the tradition of retaining backwards compatibility
with older versions. The NTPv4 version has been under development for
quite a while and isn't finished yet.
