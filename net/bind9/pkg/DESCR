   BIND 9.0.0b1 is the first public release of BIND 9 code.  It will
   be most useful to advanced users working with IPv6 or DNSSEC.

   BIND 9.0.0b1 is not functionally complete, and is not a release
   candidate for BIND 9.0.0.  The ISC anticipates a number of additional
   beta releases between now and May, when BIND 9.0.0 is scheduled to
   be released.

   The ISC does not recommend using BIND 9.0.0b1 for "production"
   services.
