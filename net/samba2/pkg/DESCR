The Samba suite is a set of programs which run under Unix-like
operating systems. These programs deliver most of the important
functionality of a Microsoft Lan Manager server. That is, they support
remote access to Un*x filespace and Un*x printers from Lan Manager
compatible clients. In practical terms, this means that such clients
can connect to and use Un*x filespace as if it was a local disk drive,
or Un*x printers as if they were local printers.

Some of the most popular Lan Manager compatible clients include Lan
Manager itself, Windows for Workgroups, OS/2 and Windows NT.

*Security Notes*
The users' encrypted passwords stored in ${PREFIX}/private/smbpasswd 
(default: /usr/local/private/smbpasswd) file *ARE PASSWORD EQUIVALENT*
from the viewpoint of SMB protocol.  Do not weaken the permission 
mode of this file (default: root.wheel and rw-------) without any special 
reasons.  And please note that even if you pkg_delete this port, 
pkg_delete will *NOT* remove smbpaswd file because pkg_delete can be used 
for upgrading this package.  If you won't use this package anymore, I 
strongly recommend you to remove smbpasswd file manually.
