NetBSD 1.4 and above ship with BIND 8, a vastly improved name server
software suite.  Unfortunately, some sites cannot run BIND 8 yet due to
various reasons, including the incompatible configuration file.

This pkg installs the naed portion of BIND 4, allowing an administrator to
use a BIND 4 server while retaining the added functionality of the BIND 8
system tools.
