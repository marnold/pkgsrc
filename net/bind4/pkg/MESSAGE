This package installs the BIND version 4 name server into your pkg tree,
NOT into /usr/sbin with your other binaries.  PLEASE BE CAREFUL as to
which named you run and which `ndc' script you use to control named.

  The `named' program in this pkg is called `named4'.
  The `ndc' script in this pkg is called `ndc4'.
  Other BIND programs are not installed; use your system installed tools.

If you intend to stick with BIND 4 instead of upgrading to BIND 8,
you should delete or move out of the way `named' and `ndc' in /usr/sbin
to eliminate confusion.
