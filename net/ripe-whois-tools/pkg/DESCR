This is a set of C programs to be used in conjunction with the RIPE
database. It contains the following programs: 

- whois 
  The RIPE version of the whois client program.
  This is intended for European users as it will query a RIPE whois
  server with extended whois capabilities rather than a standard whois
  protocol server. The whois program is fully compatible with the
  standard whois protocol and can thus replace your default whois
  program.
 
- networkupdate
  A program that allows updating the RIPE database with the whois
  protocol instead of the usual E-mail interface. This program can
  usually only be used by the administrators of the whois server itself.
  The updating mechanism is too powerfull (for now) to allow the general
  public to use this mechanism. The server is protected by means of an
  accesslist.
  
- cryptpw
  Calculate a crypted password with given password and salt.
  This password can then be used in the 'auth:' field of maintainer
  objects.
