raproxy - RealAudio application-level firewall proxy version 3.0b1

raproxy is a reference implementation of a firewall proxy. Its primary
function is to serve as a reference for people writing RealAudio
firewall proxies, but it may also be used in conjunction with security
software such as the TIS Firewall Toolkit (fwtk) to allow access to
RealAudio servers through a firewall.
