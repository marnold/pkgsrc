This package consists of two programs, collectively termed "6's Spiffy
AudioGalaxy Query Tool."

AudioGalaxy is a Napster-like music sharing server accessible at 
http://www.audiogalaxy.com.

The core program is the query tool itself, "ag."  ag accepts an AudioGalaxy
search query (that is, anything that you might type into AudioGalaxy's
search engine), runs the query for you, selects the first couple of results
returned by the search (the exact number of results selected per search is
configurable) and queues them for download, using the "Choose Versions" 
feature of AudioGalaxy to try to get a minimum (also configurable) bitrate
for your downloads.
