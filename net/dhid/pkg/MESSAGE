If you don't already have a FQDN with dhis.org domain, you will need to
register at http://www.dhis.org/sp/register.html.

You will need to install:

	${PREFIX}/share/examples/dhid.conf --> /etc/dhid.conf

and replace `idnumber', `fqdn', and `password' with your DHIS-provided
host id number, FQDN with dhis.org domain, and update password,
respectively.
