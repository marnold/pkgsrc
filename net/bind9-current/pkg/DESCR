  BIND version 9 is a major rewrite of nearly all aspects of the
underlying BIND architecture. This re-architecting of BIND was
necessitated by the expected demands of:

  - Domain name system growth, particularly in very large
    zones such as .COM
  - Protocol enhancements necessary to securely query and
    update zones
  - Protocol enhancements necessary to take advantage of
    certain architectural features of IP version 6

  The 9.0.0 release, and this release candidate, is aimed at
early adopters and those who wish to make use of new 9.0
features, such as IPv6 and DNSSEC secure resolution support.
