`lukemftp' is what many users affectionately call the enhanced ftp
client in NetBSD (http://www.netbsd.org/).  The `lukem' comes from
the account name of the NetBSD developer who wrote most of the
enhancements: Luke Mewburn <lukem@netbsd.org>.

This package is a `port' of the NetBSD ftp client to other systems.
