NapShare is a GUI based Gnutella Client.

It's a fully featured Gnutella Client designed to share any type of file
the user wishes to share.

It's a Unix clone, and it needs GTK+ (1.2 or above). Gnome is not needed. It
is currently developed and tested under Linux (Redhat 6). It is known to run
at least on Linux and FreeBSD (on 80x86 machines). It is released under the
GNU Public License (GPL).
