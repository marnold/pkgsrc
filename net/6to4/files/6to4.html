     NAME
     </h3>
<b>6to4</b>
- setup automatic 6to4 IPv6 tunnelling
     <h3>
     SYNOPSIS
     </h3>
<b>6to4</b>
[<b></b><b>-vn</b>]
<i></i><i>command</i>
     <h3>
     DESCRIPTION
     </h3>
The
<b>6to4</b>
script can be used to setup IPv6 on your home machine and
network for exploring IPv6 without any registrations. 6to4 is a
mechanism by which your IPv6 address(es) are derived from an assigned
IPv4 address, and which involves automatic tunnelling to one or more
remove 6to4 hubs, which will then forward your v6 packets on the 6bone
etc. Replies are routed back to you over IPv4 via (possibly) other
6to4 capable remote gateways. As such, IPv6-in-IPv4-encapsulated
packets are accepted from all v4-hosts.
     <p>
From your (single) IPv4 address, you get a whole IPv6 /48 network,
which allows you to split your network in 2^16 subnets, with 2^64
hosts each. You need to setup routing for your internal network
properly, help is provided for setting up the border router here.
     <p>
This script takes the burden to calculate your IPv6 address from
existing IPv4 address and runs the commands to setup (and tear down)
automatic 6to4 IPv6 tunnelling. In a seperate step, router
advertisement for the inside network can be started and stopped.
     <p>
Possible options are:
<dl compact>
<p><dt><b></b><b>-n</b><dd>
Do not. Only print the commands that would be run, but do not execute
them.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-v</b><dd>
Verbose operation. Print the commands that are about to be run, before
running them. Displays some additional information.
<p><dt><b></b><b>-h</b><dd>
Show usage.
</dl>
     <p>
Possible commands are:
<dl compact>
<p><dt><b></b><b>start</b><dd>
Configure 6to4 IPv6. The
<code>stf(4)</code>
interface is configured, and a default route to a remote 6to4
gateway is established. In addition, the internal
network interface is assigned an address.
<p><dt><b></b><b>stop</b><dd>
Stops 6to4 IPv6. All addresses are removed from the
<code>stf(4)</code>
device, and the default route is removed.
<p><dt><b></b><b>rtadvd-start</b><dd>
Starts router advertizement and IPv6 packet forwarding,
turning the machine into a IPv6 router.
<code>rtadvd(8)</code>
is invoked with a custom config file created under
<code></code><code>/var/run</code>.
Clients need to be told to use the router as
default (IPv6) router, e.g. by adding a static route.
Follow the on-screen instructions to do so.
<p><dt><b></b><b>rtadvd-stop</b><dd>
Stops router advertizement and IPv6 packet forwarding.
<code>rtadvd(8)</code>
is stopped, and the
<code>rtadvd.conf(5)</code>
config file is removed from
<code></code><code>/var/run</code>.
</dl>
     <h3>
     REQUIREMENTS
     </h3>
Besides IPv4 connectivity, you need support for IPv6 and the
<code>stf(4)</code>
device in your kernel. While the GENERIC NetBSD 1.5 kernel does
support IPv6, it does not contain support for the
<code>stf(4)</code>
device.
     <p>
Make sure you have the following options in your kernel config file:
<dl compact><dt><dd>
<code>
<pre>
options         INET          # IP + ICMP + TCP + UDP
options         INET6           # IPV6
pseudo-device  stf  1    # 6to4 IPv6 over IPv4 encapsulation
</pre>
</code>
</dl>
     <p>
No special values are needed in
<code></code><code>/etc/rc.conf</code>.
     <h3>
     CONFIGURATION
     </h3>
The
<b>6to4</b>
script reads it's configuration from a config file named
<code></code><code>6to4.conf.</code>
The
<code></code><code>6to4.conf</code>
file is in
<code>perl(1)</code>
syntax, and contains several
variables that can be tuned to adjust your setup. Default values
should work for use on a modem dialup.
<dl compact>
<p><dt><b></b><b>out_if</b><dd>
The outbound interface that has a valid IPv4 address
assigned, that can be used to derive the IPv6
addresses from. Usually
``ppp0''
for a modem setup, or your ethernet interface if you have
IPv4 connectivity via LAN. This
can't be empty, and is assigned the IPv6 address
2002:x:x:v6_net:hostbits6, see below.
<p><dt><b></b><b>in_if</b><dd>
The inside interface. If non-empty, this interface is
assigned the IPv6 address
2002:x:x:v6_innernet:hostbits6, see below.
This is only useful on machines that
have more than one network interfaces, e.g. with a modem and a
local ethernet.
<p><dt><b></b><b>v6_net</b><dd>
The subnet address you want to use on the address of
your outbound interface. Defaults to
``1''.
<p><dt><b></b><b>v6_innernet</b><dd>
The subnet address you want to use on the address of
your inbound interface. Defaults to
``2''.
<p><dt><b></b><b>hostbits6</b><dd>
The lower 64 bits of both the inbound and outbound interface's
addresses.
<p><dt><b></b><b>peer</b><dd>
Name of the remote 6to4 server that'll take our
IPv6-in-IPv4 encapsulated packets and route them on
via IPv6. Several possible values are given in the
example config file.
</dl>
     <h3>
     EXAMPLE USAGE
     </h3>
The
<b>6to4</b>
script can be run automatically by
<code>pppd(8)</code>
when a connection is made. For this, put the following into
<code></code><code>/etc/ppp/ip-up</code>:
<dl compact><dt><dd>
<code>
<pre>
( /usr/pkg/sbin/6to4 stop
  /usr/pkg/sbin/6to4 start ) &
</pre>
</code>
</dl>
     <p>
To shut down properly, put this into
<code></code><code>/etc/ppp/ip-down</code>:
<dl compact><dt><dd>
<code>
<pre>
/usr/pkg/sbin/6to4 stop
</pre>
</code>
</dl>
