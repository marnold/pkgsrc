==========================================================================
  netsaint-base has now been installed.  Before using this package for
  the first time, you need to run 'netsaint-setup.sh' and then set up the
  configuration files in @@PREFIX@@/etc/netsaint (simply copy over the
  sample configuration files you find there and edit them accordingly).

  If you want to use the web frontend, you need to make sure that the
  user your CGI scripts are running under has write access to the
  directory 'netsaint.cmd' resides in (see 'command_file' in the
  'netsaint.cfg' configuration file for more information).
  
  Please note that without plug-ins, this package will not do anything
  useful.  It is therefore recommended to install the 'netsaint-plugins'
  package as well.
