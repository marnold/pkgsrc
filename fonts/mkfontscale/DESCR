For each directory argument, mkfontscale reads all of the scalable font files
in the directory. For every font file found, an X11 font name (XLFD) is
generated, and is written together with the file name to a file fonts.scale
in the directory.

The resulting fonts.scale file should be checked and possibly manually edited
before being used as input for the mkfontdir(1) program.
