	Pcf2bdf is a font de-compiler.  It converts  X  font  from
	Portable Compiled Format (PCF) to Bitmap Distribution For-
	mat (BDF).  It can also accept  a  compressed/gzipped  PCF
	file as input, but gzip must be found in your PATH.

	FONTBOUNDINGBOX in a BDF file is not used by bdftopcf , so
	pcf2bdf generate irresponsible values.
