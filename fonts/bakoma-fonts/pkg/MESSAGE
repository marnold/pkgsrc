To use these fonts with 'dvips' (part of the teTeX package), add the
line:

p +${PREFIX}/share/tex-contrib/BaKoMa/fontmap.map

to either your ~/.dvipsrc file or create a file with that line called
config.bakoma.  When invoking 'dvips' you will need to include the
-j0 flag like:

  dvips -j0 <other dvips args>

In addition if you added the fontmap entry to a config.bakoma file
instead of your ~/.dvipsrc file then you will need to specify that
as well as a dvips argument:

  dvips -P bakoma -j0 <other dvips args>
