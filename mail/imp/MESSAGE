Please refer to the file:

	${PREFIX}/share/doc/imp/INSTALL

on how to setup your IMP installation. You need to at least edit

	${IMPDIR}/config/conf.php

You will also need to make IMP accessible through your HTTP server.  If
you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following lines
to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/horde.conf
	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/imp.conf

and then you have to edit
	${PREFIX}/share/horde/config/registry.php
to enable IMP in the horde framework.

If you are updating from IMP 2.2.x, use the script
	${PREFIX}/share/horde/imp/scripts/imp2horde.pl
to convert the IMP 2.2.x user preference database to the new format.
