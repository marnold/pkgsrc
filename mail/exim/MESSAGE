To use exim, you will need to perform the following steps manually; it is
inappropriate for this package to make the changes for you.

1. Set the correct ownership and permissions on the exim log directory:
   chown mail:mail /var/log/exim && chmod 750 /var/log/exim
3. Read the documentation. Edit ${PREFIX}/etc/exim/configure to taste.
4. Back-up /etc/mailer.conf to /etc/mailer.conf.sendmail.
   Copy ${PREFIX}/etc/exim/mailer.conf.exim to /etc/mailer.conf.
5. Set 'sendmail=NO', 'exim=YES' and exim_flags to some sane value in
   /etc/rc.conf (previously it was "-bd -q15m"). Copy ${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/exim
   to /etc/rc.d.
6. Configuring log rotation is dependant on personal taste and the version of
   NetBSD in use. See weekly.conf(5), newsyslog(8), exicyclog and eximstats.

Also note:

1. Try `pkg_info exim` to see which features are enabled in this build.
2. Consider enabling SSL (STARTTLS) for receiving mail in your config.
   This build automatically uses SSL when sending mail.
