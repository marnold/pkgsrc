  Evolution is the integrated mail, calendar and address book distributed
suite from Ximian, Inc.  Evolution represents the next step forward in
GNOME applications.  The tools which make up Evolution are tightly
integrated with one another and act as a seamless personal
information-management tool.

  Note that Evolution is still beta.  This means it may delete all of your
mail if you give it the chance!  The message composer currently does not
work under NetBSD.  Also, please note that Evolution uses a huge number of
resources.  Make sure you increase user and kernel limits for open files
and processes if you run into trouble!
