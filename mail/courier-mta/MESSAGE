It is recommended that Courier-MTA be installed together with Courier-IMAP
and SqWebMail -- together, they form an integrated mail/groupware
server suite that provides ESMTP, IMAP, POP3, webmail, and mailing
list services within a single, consistent framework that may be managed
through a web CGI application.

There are two things which must be done to make the Courier ``webadmin''
CGI application accessible through your HTTP server:

  (1) Copy the ``courierwebadmin'' CGI binary to the appropriate place in
      your HTTP document root, e.g. ${PREFIX}/libexec/cgi-bin, then
      Courier webadmin would be accessible through:

        http://your.domain.com/cgi-bin/courierwebadmin

  (2) Install a password to protect the ``webadmin'' CGI application by
      creating a one-line file containing the plaintext password at:

        ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/webadmin/password

      This file should be owned by ${COURIER_USER}:${COURIER_GROUP} with
      read-only permissions restricted to the owner (mode 0400).
