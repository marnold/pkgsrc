getmail is intended as a simple replacement for fetchmail. It retrieves mail
(either all messages, or only unread messages) from one or more POP3 servers
for one or more email accounts, and reliably delivers into a qmail-style
Maildir (or mbox file) specified on a per-account basis. It also has support
for domain (multidrop) mailboxes.
