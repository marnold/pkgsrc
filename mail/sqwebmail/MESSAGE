You must create a cron job that runs at regular intervals to clean the
SqWebMail user cache that executes the following script:

    ${PREFIX}/share/courier/sqwebmail/cleancache.pl

You will need to make SqWebMail accessible through your HTTP server by
making URLs with path "/images/sqwebmail/" resolve to the images in
${IMAGEDIR}.

If you are running Apache, then you may add the following snippet into
httpd.conf:

    <IfModule mod_alias.c>
        Alias /images/sqwebmail/ "${IMAGEDIR}/"
    </IfModule>

Also, certain versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer have a bug in their
HTTP/1.1 protocol implementation that results in errors when downloading
attachments.  You should configure your HTTP server to force a HTTP/1.0
protocol response for MSIE clients, e.g. for Apache, add the following to
httpd.conf:
                                                                                
    BrowserMatch "MSIE [45]" nokeepalive downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0

Maildir accounts will be accessible through:

    http://www.domain.com/cgi-bin/sqwebmail
