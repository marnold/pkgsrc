You should update the virus databases to the latest ones available
before using ClamAV.  This can be done by running the following command
as `${ROOT_USER}' or `${CLAMAV_USER}':

	${PREFIX}/bin/freshclam

Note that as of version 0.80, clamav.conf has been replaced by
clamd.conf. Be sure to update your configuration to reflect this.
