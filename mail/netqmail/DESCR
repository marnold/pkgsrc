Charles Cazabon, Dave Sill, Henning Brauer, Peter Samuel, and
Russell Nelson have put together a netqmail-1.05 distribution of
qmail. It is comprised of qmail-1.03 plus a patch file, some
documentation, and a shell script which prepares the files for
compilation.

We have done this because in our opinion, too many new users are
confused by the out-of-date INSTALL file, and too much time is
spent arguing on the mailing list over bugs. We have tried to stick
to the barest minimum number of changes. We have fixed only those
things which are out-and-out wrong, or which have been approved by
djb (specifically QMAILQUEUE).
