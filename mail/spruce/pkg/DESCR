spruce - a MIME-aware, GNOME-based email program

- Understands MIME, and can send and receive MIME attachments.
- Can incorporate mail using POP
- Doesn't understand unix-style maildrops (aah, youth...)
- Has the beginnings of PGP support
- Seems like it's actually pretty far along, and builds pretty cleanly,
  which is unique so far in my experience with Gnome mailers... :'/
