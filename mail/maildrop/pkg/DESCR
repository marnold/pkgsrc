  maildrop is a replacement for your local mail delivery agent.  maildrop
reads a mail message from standard input, then delivers the message to your
mailbox.  maildrop knows how to deliver mail to mbox-style mailboxes, and
maildirs.  "maildir" is a mailbox format used by the Qmail MTA.

  maildrop will optionally read instructions from a file, which describes
how to filter incoming mail.  Instructions can be provided having mail
delivered to alternate mailboxes, or forwarded somewhere else.  Unlike
procmail, maildrop uses a structured filtering language.

  maildrop is written in C++, and is significantly larger than procmail in
compiled form.  However, it uses resources much more efficiently.  Unlike
procmail, maildrop will not read a 10 megabyte mail message into memory.
Large messages are saved in a temporary file, and are filtered from the
temporary file.  Temporary files are saved in the user's home directory.
If the standard input to maildrop is a file, and not a pipe, a temporary
file will not be necessary.

  maildrop checks the syntax of the mail delivery instructions the filter
file, before attempting to deliver a message.  Unlike procmail, if the filter
file contains syntax errors, maildrop terminates without delivering the
message.  The user can fix the typo without causing any mail to be lost.
