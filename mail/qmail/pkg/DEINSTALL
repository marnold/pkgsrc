echo Note: this package did not remove qmail users and groups in case you may
echo want to use them later.
echo
echo These qmail users still exist in the system:
echo "	alias qmaill qmaild qmailp qmailq qmailr qmails"
echo and these groups:
echo "	nofiles qmail"
echo
echo If you won\'t be using ${PKGNAME} any longer, you may remove qmail
echo users and groups automatically by typing \"make remove-users\".
echo
echo Directories \"alias control queue users\" from ${QMAILDIR} were also untouched
echo and they are ready for future use. You may safely remove them - type \"make remove-dirs\".
