# gutenprint has many options, and really should be split into
# multiple packages.  Splitting is difficult because of the structure
# of the upstream distribution.  For now, this package contains
# everything that gdt wants, because that seems more useful to users
# than not having gutenprint in pkgsrc.

GNU_CONFIGURE=		YES

# XXX Make command.types be a CONF_FILE

# Adjust configure to disable components that we don't want.  For
# components that should eventually be in split packages, we mark them
# as such.  Related configure options are grouped together; for now we list
# many default options that probably will not be exercised.

# GTK1 ui and gimp1 plugin.  These are obsolete and will not
# be supported.
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--disable-libgutenprintui
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-gimp

# CUP support.  This should be in a split package
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-cups
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--enable-cups-1_2-enhancements
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--disable-cups-ppds
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--disable-translated-cups-ppds

# Ghostscript support.  This should be in split packages, if at all.
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-ghost

# GTK2 ui and gimp2 plugin
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--disable-libgutenprintui2
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-gimp2
# By default, the gimp2 plugin is named gutenprint
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--with-gimp2-as-gutenprint

# Foomatic support.  This should be in a split package, if at all.
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-foomatic		# split-pkg
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--with-foomatic3		# IN ABOVE

# Disable translated ppds.  Without this option, there are dozens of
# copies of each printer, differing in the CUPS UI only by a language
# code.  The awkwardness seems to outweigh the benefit.
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-translated-ppds

# Sample images.  These are small so there seems to be no point in
# omitting them.
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--disable-samples		# base

# escputil.  This is a utility for epson printers.  It should arguably
# be in a split package, but it is tiny so there is little point other
# than cleanliness.
#CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--disable-escputil
# XXX Something in gutenprint seems to use readline, but it's not clear why,
# so just disable it to reduce dependencies.
CONFIGURE_ARGS+=	--without-readline

# test pattern generator.
