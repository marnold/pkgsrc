  Gnome is in need of a unified printing architecture. This package is an
attempt for such an architecture, geared towards heavily graphics-intensive
applications. 

    The goals of this architecture include: 

      - Absolutely uncompromised output quality 
      - Speed, memory efficiency, and other related performance goals 
      - Ability to work smoothly with PostScript printers, fonts, and
        other resources 
      - A screen display derived from the Caanvas 
      - An extension path for a wide variety of Unicode scripts 
      - An extension path for a richer set of graphics operators than
        PostScript supports, especially transparency 
      - To make life as easy as possible for application developers
