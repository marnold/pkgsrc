Dvipdfm is a DVI to PDF translator. Its features include: 

o TeX \special's that approximate the functionality of the PostScript pdfmarks
  used by Adobe Acrobat Distiller. Links, outlines, articles, and named
  destinations are supported, for example.
o Support for standard DVI specials such as the HyperTeX specials and the TPIC
  specials. 
o Support for thumbnails (with help from GhostScript).
o Ability to include PDF, PNG, and JPEG files as embedded images. For PDF
  files, only the first page is included. Resources will be embedded from the
  original file as necessary. File inclusion does not work for PDF files that
  store the page contents in several segments in an array.
o Virtual font support
o Support for both Type1 and PK fonts. 
o Support for arbitrary linear graphics transformations. Any material on the
  page can be scaled and rotated. 
o A color stack accessible via \special's. 
o Partial font embedding and stream compression for reduced output file size 
o Balanced page and destination trees for improved reader access on very large
  document files.

dvipdfm was developed by Mark A. Wicks.
Japanization by Shunsaku Hirata.
