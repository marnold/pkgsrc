This program makes PNG graphics from DVI files as obtained from
TeX and its relatives.

It is intended to produce anti-aliased screen-resolution images as
fast as is possible. The target audience is people who need to
generate and regenerate many images again and again. The primary
target is the preview-latex (X)Emacs package, a package to preview
formulas from within (X)Emacs. Yes, you get to see your formulas
in the (X)Emacs buffer, see `http://preview-latex.sf.net'.

Another example is WeBWorK, an internet-based method for delivering
homework problems to students over the internet, giving students
instant feedback as to whether or not their answers are correct,
see `http://webwork.math.rochester.edu'.

Other applications may also benefit, like web applications as
latex2html and WYSIWYG editors like LyX.
