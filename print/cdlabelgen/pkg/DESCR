cdlabelgen was designed to simplify the process of
generating labels for CD's. It originated as a program
to allow auto generation of frontcards and traycards
for CD's burned via an automated mechanism
(specifically for archiving data), but has now become
popular for labelling CD compilations of mp3's, and
copies of CDs. Note that cdlabelgen does not
actually print anything--it just spits out postscript,
which you can then do with as you please.
