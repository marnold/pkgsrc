Xpdf is a viewer for Portable Document Format (PDF) files. 

Xpdf is designed to be small and efficient. It runs under X, 
but does not use the Motif or Xt libraries. Use of the T1 library 
provides superior rendering of type 1 fonts, and also permits 
run-time configuration of the exact fonts to be used.
