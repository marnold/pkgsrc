The foomatic-gswrapper script runs Ghostscript in a more controlled and
makes debugging much easier by letting you see Ghostscript error messsages.
The wrapper is required if you print jobs from the Windows PostScript
driver (which writes jobs that generate advisory output that causes trouble
under plain Ghostscript).  Some other software may produce such jobs; the
wrapper is probably a good idea in general.
