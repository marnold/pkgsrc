Quickstart quide:

0) Choose a home for emech, where the user running emech will have write 
   permission. For instance, /var/run/emech

1) cp ${PREFIX}/share/example/emech/sample.set ${PREFIX}/etc/mech.set

2) vi ${PREFIX}/etc/mech.set
-- look through the file for sections to change,  you will have to remove 
   lines in order to get the bot to work. Check the file completely!

3) genuser /var/run/emech/emech.users
-- It seems that things work better with a DNS address in the hostmask 
   instead of an IP address..

4) cd /var/tun/emech/
-- the user that will be running emech needs write access to this directory

5) ${PREFIX}/bin/mech -f ${PREFIX}/etc/mech.set
-- The full path to the binary is mandatory.

6) See documentation in ${PREFIX}/share/example/emech/mech.help and on
   http://www.energymech.net/docs/
