This is America Online's ubiquitious Instant Messenger (SM), a
chat-type client that enables you to converse with any AOL or AIM
user. You'll need to have a "netscape" binary in your path to complete
the (free) registration -- the www/netscape package is fine --, or
you can use your ID from Netscape Netcenter, CompuServe 2000, AOL
Hometown, or AOL.com's Personal Finance center.
