Gabber is a Free and Open Source GNOME client for an instant messaging
system called Jabber. Jabber is a Free and Open Source distributed
instant messaging system. It does not rely on a single server, and the
protocol is well documented. Jabber allows communication with many
different instant messaging systems, including ICQ and AIM. There are
several different Jabber clients already, but no other GNOME clients
as of this writing. Hopefully Gabber will serve the purpose of being a
robust GNOME Jabber client well.

Jabber.org for developer news.
