kicq is an ICQ (I seek you) client, specifically designed for the KDE desktop.
kicq has a simple, clean interface very similar to the original Windows ICQ 
client, and includes all of the most commonly used ICQ features such as 
messaging, real-time chat, and file transfer.
kicq is beta code - use it at your own risk. It was developed under the GPL 
without consent from AOL/Mirabilis. No reverse engineering or decompilation 
of code was performed in order to create this program.
