The author says:

	Liece is a client implementation of IRC (Internet Relay Chat, RFC
	1459).  It works under GNU Emacs or XEmacs.

	We are aiming at unified interface to the protocols whose clients have
	to handle a number of messages just in time (IRC, AIM, ICQ, etc.).

Liece has many advanced features, atractive user interface, and is being
actively developed.
