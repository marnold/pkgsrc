  NewsCache is a free cache server for USENET News available under the GNU
General Public License.  NewsCache can be plugged in between your news
reader(s) and your news server.  NewsCache acts to news readers like a news
server and retrieves news articles from the news server like a news reader.
Whenever, a client requests an article from NewsCache, NewsCache checks
whether the article has already been stored in the cache area.  If this is
the case, the article is sent directly to its client.  Otherwise, the article
is requested from the upstream news server, stored in the cache area and sent
back to the client. 

  NewsCache provides the following functionality: 

   * Offline news reading. 
   * Small articles are stored within a single database.  This improves
     performance and reduces the number of inodes used of your system. 
   * The overview-database is generated on the fly for articles already
     cached by the cache server.
   * This reduces the amount of disk space used, but decreases performance
     slightly. 
   * The newsgroup-database is now managed as an array instead of a list to
     allow direct access to articles. 
   * Merging different news servers to a virtual feed (on a per newsgroup
     basis).
