This package contains a plugin for the Merb framework that provides
support for handling assets and asset bundling.

The key to making a fast web application is to reduce both the amount
of data transfered and the number of client-server interactions.  While
having many small, module Javascript or stylesheet files aids in the
development process, your web application will benefit from bundling
those assets in the production environment.

An asset bundle is a set of asset files which are combined into a single
file.  This reduces the number of requests required to render a page,
and can reduce the amount of data transfer required if you're using gzip
encoding.
