This is version 0.87 of Apache::AuthDBI.pm and Apache::DBI.pm.

These modules are supposed to be used with the Apache server together with 
an embedded perl interpreter like mod_perl. They provide support for basic 
authentication and authorization as well as support for persistent database 
connections via Perl's Database Independent Interface (DBI). 

o AuthDBI.pm provides authentication and authorization: 

  - optional shared cache for passwords to minimize database load 
  - configurable cleanup-handler deletes outdated entries from the cache 

o DBI.pm provides persistent database connections: 

  - connections can be established during server-startup 
  - configurable rollback to ensure data integrity 
  - configurable verification of the connections to avoid time-outs. 

The modules have been developed on RH 6.0 with apache_1.3.6 and mod_perl-1.21.
