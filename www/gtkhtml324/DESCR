GtkHTML is a lightweight HTML rendering/printing/editing engine. It
was originally based on KHTMLW, part of the KDE project, but is now
being developed independently.

This package contains the "3.24" API version of GtkHTML.  For the
older 3.14 API, see gtkhtml314.  For the older 3.8 API, see gtkhtml38.
