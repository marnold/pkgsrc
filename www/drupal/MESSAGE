To complete the setup you will need to read the INSTALL.txt in order

You will need to make Drupal accessible through your HTTP server.
If you are running Apache then you may add the following lines to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/drupal.conf

to make Drupal accessible through:

	http://localhost/drupal/
