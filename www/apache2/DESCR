Apache is an HTTP server designed as a plug-in replacement for
the NCSA server version 1.3 (or 1.4). It fixes numerous bugs in
the NCSA server and includes many frequently requested new
features, and has an API which allows it to be extended to meet
users' needs more easily.

Note that the pkgsrc directory builds and installs an alpha version of
Apache.
