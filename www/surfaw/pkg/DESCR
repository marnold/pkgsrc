Surfaw provides a fast unix command line interface to a variety of
popular WWW search engines and other artifacts of power. It reclaims
google, altavista, dejanews, amazon.com, research index, slashdot
and many others from the false-prophet, pox-infested heathen lands of
html-forms, placing these wonders where they belong, deep in unix
heartland, as god loving extensions to the shell.

Surfaw abstracts the browser away from input. Doing so lets it get
on with what it's good at. Browsing. Interpretation of linguistic
forms is handed back to the shell, which is what it, and human
beings are good at. Combined with incremental text browsers, such as
links, w3m (or even lynx), and screen(1) a Surfaw liberateur is
capable of research speeds that leave GUI tainted idolaters agape
with fear and wonder.
