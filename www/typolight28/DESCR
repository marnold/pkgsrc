TYPOlight is an open source content management system (CMS) for people who
want a professional internet presence that is easy to maintain.
The state-of-the-art structure of the system offers a high security standard
and allows you to develop search engine friendly websites that are also
accessible for people with disabilities.  Furthermore, the system can be
expanded flexibly and inexpensively.  Easy management of user rights, the
Live Update Service, the modern CSS framework and many already integrated
modules (news, calendar, forms, etc.) have quickly made TYPOlight one of the
most popular open source content management systems on the market.

TYPOlight has an intuitive user interface that uses Ajax and Web 2.0
technologies for optimal usability.  Multiple back end languages and themes,
a powerful permission system, versioning and undo management, advanced search
and sorting options or the Live Update Service are just a few of many
features that make TYPOlight stand out from other CMS.  The TYPOlight front
end is 100% template based and generates accessible XHTML strict output that
meets the W3C/WAI requirements.  Search engine friendly URLs, GZip support, a
PDF export function, multi-language support and many more allow you to build
contemporary websites without being a programmer.
