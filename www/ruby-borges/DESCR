Borges is a web application framework that allows linear
programming of web applications.

Borges runs on Webrick (Apache+DRb will be supported in
the near future) and features a simple rendering interface.

Those who are interested will likely be greatly helped by
the Seaside 2.0 docs at  http://beta4.com/seaside2/
