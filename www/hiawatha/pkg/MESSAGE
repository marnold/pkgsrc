  Hiawatha has now been successfully installed.

  In order to use Hiawatha, you will need to create spool
  directories, named

	/var/spool/hiawatha/SPOOL${PORT}

  for each TCP port on which hiawatha will be listening --
  for example

	/var/spool/hiawatha/SPOOL8080

  for the example hiawatha.cfg distributed with this
  package.

  You can start hiawatha by running

	${PREFIX}/etc/rc.d/hiawatha start
