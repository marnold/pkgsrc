mod_ruby embeds the Ruby interpreter into the Apache web server,
allowing Ruby CGI scripts to be executed natively.  These scripts will
start up much faster than without mod_ruby.
This package is the development version, which supports apache2 under
the prefork and threaded MVM. For Apache 1.3.XX, see www/ap-ruby.
