Contao is an Open Source Content Management Framework developed by Leo Feyer
and distributed under the LGPL license (see GPL.txt and LGPL.txt for more
information). It was formerly known as TYPOlight Open Source CMS. Its open
architecture allows everybody to extend the system to fit his needs. Contao
specializes in accessible websites and is accessbile itself (front end and
back end), rendering valid XHTML pages.

Note: Live update feature would work with contao-liveupdate PKG_OPTION
enabled, but it might be conflict with regular pkgsrc maintainous.
