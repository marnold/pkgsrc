    Now running the Netscape 7 installation program.  Note that the
    installation requires a working internet connection and the DISPLAY
    environment variable to be set.

    1) Choose 'Next' on the first screen

    2) Choose 'Accept' on the End-User License Agreement (EULA)

    3) Do not change settings from "Recommended" on the
       next screen, but do change the  "Destination Directory" to:

        @WRKSRC@/dest

       Then press 'Next'.

    4) Set the proxy settings as appropriate for you and click 'Install'

    5) Lean back and wait while the installer downloads the necessary files. 
       Depending on the speed of your connection, this may take a while.

    6) Click 'Ok' on "Installation has completed."

    7) Netscape7 will now start and try to convince you to register with
       Netscape.  It's up to you to do so, but it's not required.  Exit
       Netscape to continue the package installation.
