The latest version of the most popular web server on the 'net.
This compile includes proxy server support, as well as the ability
to add modules that add many other features.

You'll have to edit the configuration files in /usr/pkg/http/conf
before you start it. The default root directory for documents is
/usr/pkg/http/htdocs. You can start the server with `apachectl start'.
