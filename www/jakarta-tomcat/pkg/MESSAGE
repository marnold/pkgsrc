Tomcat can be started and stopped with the following commands:

	cd ${JAVAHOME}/jakarta/tomcat && ./startup.sh
	cd ${JAVAHOME}/jakarta/tomcat && ./shutdown.sh

By default, this will start the Tomcat webserver on port 8080

To get Tomcat working with Apache Server, see

	${JAVAHOME}/jakarta/tomcat/Tomcat+Apache-HOWTO
