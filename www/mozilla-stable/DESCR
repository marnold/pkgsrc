Mozilla is the freely available version of Netscape's browser. Because
only freely distributable code is included, some features are not
present. But that will change.

This is a stable branch of mozilla.
A select group of APIs have been marked "@FROZEN. Mozilla.org intends
to maintain API compatibility for this set until next major release.
This branch is targeted at the developer community and enables 
the creation of Internet-based applications.
