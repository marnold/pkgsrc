Tired of getting teased by Windows users because your Mozilla isn't as |<()()|_
as theirs? Well, your problems are almost solved. Plugger is a multimedia
plugin for Unix Mozilla, Opera or Netscape that handles Quicktime, MPEG, MP2,
AVI, SGI-movie, Tiff, DL, IFF-anim, MIDI, Soundtracker, AU, WAV and Commodore
64 audio files. And now, with Plugger 5.1.3, MPEG audio and video can be played
streaming. No more waiting! Plugger is a very small plugin, because Plugger
uses external programs to show/play the different formats.
