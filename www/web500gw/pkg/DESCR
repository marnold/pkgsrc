A gateway that connects WWW browsers to LDAP based directories.

Web500gw expects HTTP requests from a WWW browser on a TCP port (usually 8888). 
Depending on the requested URL web500gw performs read/search/modify/add/delete 
requests to the Directory and sends HTML pages back to the browser. 
Web500gw uses the LDAPv2 protocol to talk to a Directory server. It is able to 
work with a Standalone LDAP server (like UMich/OpenLDAP slapd or Netscape LDAP 
product) and with an LDAP Frontend to an X.500 Directory System Agent.
