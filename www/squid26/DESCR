Squid is a fully-featured HTTP/1.0 proxy which is almost (but not
quite - we're getting there!) HTTP/1.1 compliant. Squid offers a rich
access control, authorization and logging environment to develop web
proxy and content serving applications.

This Squid 2.6 is legacy release for now and it will retire in the future.
