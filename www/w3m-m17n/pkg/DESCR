Introduction

  I have tried the muntilingualization of w3m (w3m-m17n).
  The patch for w3m-0.2.1 is available on the following site.

                                                README.m17n

  It is a development version. And enough test is not preformed because
  I can understand Japanese only. Please use, test, and report bugs.
