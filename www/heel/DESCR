Heel is a mongrel based web server to quickly and easily serve up the
contents of a directory as webpages.  Beyond just serving up webpages
heel uses an ERB template and famfamfam icons to create useful index
pages.  And to make things even easier it launches your browser for
you so no cut and paste necessary.
