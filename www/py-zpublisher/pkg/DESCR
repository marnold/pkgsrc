ZPublisher is the Zope ORB.  It provides a simple mechanism for
publishing a collection of Python objects as World-Wide-Web (Web)
resources without any plumbing (e.g.  CGI) specific code.  The Zope ORB
is the central component of the Zope web application platform.  It can
also be used without the rest of Zope.  ZPublisher applications can be
published as regular CGIs, using Persistent CGI ("PCGI") (see the
py-pcgi package), or on the command line with the "bobo" program.
