  Description
  ___________

  This Apache module provides strong cryptography for the Apache 1.3 webserver
  via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL v2/v3) and Transport Layer Security (TLS
  v1) protocols by the help of the SSL/TLS implementation library SSLeay from
  Eric A. Young and Tim J. Hudson. 
 
  The mod_ssl package was created in April 1998 by Ralf S. Engelschall and was
  originally derived from software developed by Ben Laurie for use in the
  Apache-SSL HTTP server project.  Additionally it uses a tool developed by
  Larry Wall and David MacKenzie for use in the GNU project of the FSF.
