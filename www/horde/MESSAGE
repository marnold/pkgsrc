Please refer to the file:

	${PREFIX}/share/doc/horde/INSTALL

to setup Horde to access its database properly.  The short summary is to
edit:

	${HORDEDIR}/config/horde.php

to specify the correct backend database, and run the appropriate scripts
in:

	${HORDEDIR}/scripts/db

to setup the horde database.  Horde is setup by default to access MySQL.
It's recommended that you change the password of the 'hordemgr' user used
to connect to the horde database.  For localhost security, the file

	${HORDEDIR}/config/horde.php

should be accessible only to the webserver process as it contains the
horde database password.

You will also need to make Horde accessible through your HTTP server.  If
you are running Apache and ap-php, then you can add the following line
to httpd.conf:

	Include ${PKG_SYSCONFDIR}/horde.conf

to make Horde accessible through:
	
	http://www.domain.com/horde/
