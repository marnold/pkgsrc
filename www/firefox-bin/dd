* Download Manager

The new streamlined download manager keeps your downloads organized
without getting in your way. Select Tools > Downloads or press
Ctrl+E to see it or change its behavior.

* New Add Bookmark Dialog

The Add Bookmark dialog has been enhanced and now allows the creation
of new bookmark folders.

* Work Offline

It's now possible to view Web pages you've previously visited
without being connected to the Internet.

* Better Handling of File Types

Binary files (e.g. .wma and .rar files) served by servers incorrectly
sending text/plain should no longer be displayed as garbage in the
browser, rather they should be appropriately handled.

* New XPInstall Frontend

The dialog that appears when installing themes and extensions has
been redesigned and is easier to use.

* Lots of bug fixes and improvements

Disabling of form auto-completion is now working, the address bar
now remembers the edited text across tab switching, among many
other bug fixes.
