mdd stands for multicast data dump. It was designed for distributing 
a file using multicast. The primary goal was to replicate a hard disk
image on all the workstations of a computer room at the same time.

The protocol used is rather simple and will not make any effort to avoid
flooding your network. IGMP-snooping enabled switches are advised.
