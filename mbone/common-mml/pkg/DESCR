The UCL common multimedia library implements a number of algorithms and
protocols needed by a number of our applications. It compiles standalone
on a range of Unix systems (Solaris, Linux, Irix, FreeBSD) and on Windows
95/98/NT. 

The following protocols/algorithms are included in the library: 

 * Base64 encoding/decoding 
 * Binary tree 
 * Random number 
 * HMAC authentication 
 * MD5 
 * DES 
 * RTP 
 * Mbus
