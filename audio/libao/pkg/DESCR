Libao is a cross-platform audio library that allows programs to
output audio using a simple API on a wide variety of platforms.
libao currently supports:
   * Null output
   * WAV files
   * OSS (Open Sound System)
   * ESD (ESounD or Enlighten Sound Daemon)
   * ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture)
   * Solaris (untested)
   * IRIX (untested)

This NetBSD package uses /dev/audio (instead of /dev/sound/dsp)
for the OSS support.
