  gdcd is a CD player for the X Window System which uses the GIMP Tool
Kit (GTK) and libcdaudio.  It is in quite early development at this point,
but should become quite a bit more functional as time goes on.

There are currently 3 working parts of gdcd:

Button Panel: 
    The button panel provides 8 buttons for controlling CD-ROM operations.
    Ideas for the cosmetic design of these buttons are quite obviously
    borrowed from another excellent GTK-based X CD player, XfreeCD.  Every
    single one of them is working in this release, though extended
    functionality to them will appear in future releases (such as
    customizable seek control with the forward/reverse buttons.)

Status Bar: 
    The status bar is gdcd's only method of output in this release.  It
    displays the status of network and CD-ROM operations, as well as the
    track being played when play is started.

Cover Art Display: 
    The cover art display shows the art from the cover of the album
    currently in the CD-ROM, or if it can't be located, a splash screen
    for the disc's genre.
