MBROLA is a  speech synthesizer  based  on the concatenation  of
diphones. It takes a list of phonemes as input, together with prosodic
information  (duration of phonemes  and a piecewise linear description
of  pitch), and produces  speech samples  on 16  bits (linear), at the
sampling frequency of the diphone database. 

It is therefore NOT a Text-To-Speech  (TTS) synthesizer, since it does
not accept raw text as input.  In  order to obtain  a full TTS system,
you need to use this synthesizer in combination with a text processing
system that produces phonetic and prosodic commands.

We maintain a web page with pointers to such freely available systems:

This software is the heart of the MBROLA project,  the aim of which is
to   obtain  a set a   speech  synthesizers for as   many languages as
possible, free of use for non-commercial applications.
mbrola.exe  or mbrola: An  executable  file of the synthesizer  itself
(depends on the computer supposed to run it) 
readme.txt : This file

As   such,  it  requires an  MBROLA    language/voice database  to run
properly.   American  English,  Brazilian  Portuguese, Breton, British
English, Croatian, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Romanian, Spanish and
Swedish  voices are made   available. Additional languages and  voices
will be available in the context of the MBROLA project.

Please consult the MBROLA project homepage to get the voices:
