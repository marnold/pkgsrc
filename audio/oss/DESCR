Open Sound System(TM) (OSS) is the first attempt in unifying the digital
audio architecture for UNIX.  OSS is a set of device drivers that provide a
uniform API across all the major UNIX architectures.  It supports Sound
Blaster or Windows Sound System compatible sound cards which can be plugged
into any UNIX workstation supporting the ISA or PCI bus architecture.  OSS
also supports workstations with on-board digital audio hardware.
