If you want other skins, you can download them from
http://www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Haven/5235/mpeg-skin.html
To unpack them into HOME/.gqmpeg/skins then type
"gqmpeg -skin:skinfile (the skin in the directory named skinfile)" to use them.

  Shoutcast support:
    (unsupported, very buggy) (not available in binary packages)
    Shoutcast support _requires_ mpg123 0.59pre-p ..
              ... mpg123 0.59o WILL NOT WORK!
    The shoutcast directory of the source code includes a script and
    instructions to use GQmpeg as a netscape plugin for shoutcast(.com)
