MAD is a high-quality MPEG audio decoder. It currently supports MPEG 1 as
well as the MPEG 2 extension to Lower Sampling Frequencies. All three
audio layers (Layer I, Layer II, and Layer III aka MP3) are fully
implemented.

MAD does not yet support MPEG 2 multichannel audio (although it should be
backward compatible with such streams), nor does it support the so-called
MPEG 2.5 format.

MAD has the following special features:

  - 24-bit PCM output
  - 100% fixed-point (integer) computation
  - completely new implementation based on the ISO/IEC standards
  - distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL)
