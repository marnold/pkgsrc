In order to make sure that SDL uses the aRts daemon to output sound, you
must set the environmental variable SDL_AUDIO_PLUGIN to `arts'.  This can
be done with the following command:

	export SDL_AUDIO_PLUGIN="arts"

WARNING: Loadable audio plugins are a pkgsrc extension and will not work if
you use an SDL library coming from anywhere else.
