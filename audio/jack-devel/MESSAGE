NOTE:  Unfortunately, JACK wants to use a linux /proc filesystem to
perform shared memory housekeeping tasks.  Therefore, if your platform
supports a "Linux-compliant" proc filesystem, we recommend mounting one
prior to using jack.  On NetBSD, this can be accomplished with the
following command:

		mount_procfs -orw,linux /proc <mount point>

Conventionally, the mount point is /proc.  If you wish to use a different
pathname for this filesystem, you may define the JACKD_PROCFS_PATH
variable in your build environment or mk.conf as shown below.

		JACKD_PROCFS_PATH= /emul/linux/proc
