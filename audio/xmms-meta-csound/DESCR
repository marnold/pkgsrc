This is an input script for xmms-meta-input which allows xmms to play
unified Csound scores using csound.

An example unified Csound score may be found at
ftp://ftp.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/misc/ben/example.csd.gz

Many Csound songs are distributed in separate orchestra, score, and sample
files.  A script to convert these to a unified Csound score file is at
