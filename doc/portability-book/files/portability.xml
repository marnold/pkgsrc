	<para>pkgsrc is a package management system that has been ported
	to various POSIX-like operating systems. These systems differ in
	a lot of small details that are all nice to know when writing
	code that will later run on as many of these platforms as
	possible. This book collects some of the limitations, bugs and
	other characteristics of the pkgsrc platforms.</para>
