x11/kdebase3/patches/patch-aa			1.4

	open_file_shared(): when falling back to O_RDONLY open_file() call 
	after O_RDWR fails in fcbopen case, remember the errno from 
	previous open_file() call and set errno back to this value if the 
	second open_file() call fails too.

	This makes samba report EACCESS instead of confusing ENOENT if 
	creation of file fails due to insufficient permissions for 
	SMBcreate/SMBmknew call.

net/samba/patches/patch-ar			1.2

	Updated samba to 2.2.8

	****************************************
	* IMPORTANT: Security bugfix for Samba *
	****************************************

	The SuSE security audit team, in particular Sebastian Krahmer
	<krahmer@suse.de>, has found a flaw in the Samba main smbd code which
	could allow an external attacker to remotely and anonymously gain
	Super User (root) privileges on a server running a Samba server.
	
	This flaw exists in previous versions of Samba from 2.0.x to 2.2.7a
	inclusive.  This is a serious problem and all sites should either
	upgrade to Samba 2.2.8 immediately or prohibit access to TCP ports 139
	and 445. Advice created by Andrew Tridgell, the leader of the Samba
	Team, on how to protect an unpatched Samba server is given at the end
	of this section.

	The SMB/CIFS protocol implemented by Samba is vulnerable to many
	attacks, even without specific security holes.  The TCP ports 139 and
	the new port 445 (used by Win2k and the Samba 3.0 alpha code in
	particular) should never be exposed to untrusted networks.

net/samba/Makefile.common			1.8
net/samba/distinfo				1.28

	Update to Samba 2.2.8a.

	Changes since 2.2.8:
	Digital Defense, Inc. has alerted the Samba Team to a serious
	vulnerability in all stable versions of Samba currently shipping.
	The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) project has assigned
	the ID CAN-2003-0201 to this defect.

	This vulnerability, if exploited correctly, leads to an anonymous
	user gaining root access on a Samba serving system. All versions
	of Samba up to and including Samba 2.2.8 are vulnerable. An active
	exploit of the bug has been reported in the wild.
