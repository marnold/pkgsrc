argument. Handle differently.
	[abs]

graphics/avifile-devel/patches/patch-ac		1.3 (new)

Add suitable arguments to "avifile-config --libs" for autodetected XFree 4

with XFree 4 -- not tested.
	[fredb]

graphics/apla/Makefile				1.14

This builds again on NetBSD 1.6.1, but only against the latest version
of avifile-devel. Bump pkgrevision.
