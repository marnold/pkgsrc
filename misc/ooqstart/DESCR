Open Office QuickStarter applet for GNOME

This applet provides a quick launcher for Open Office 641C+ or Star
Office 6.0+.  It attempts to mimic the functionality provided by the
quickstarter tray icon on the other operating system supported by
Open Office.

The program attempts to keep a background process alive at all
times, even if that process is terminated by the user. The four main
applications: Writer, Calc, Draw, and Impress can be launched
directly from the context menu of the applet.
