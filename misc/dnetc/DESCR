distributed.net believes in the capability and potential of
distributed computing. Their mission consists of three interdependent
goals: development, deployment, and advocacy, to be pursued in the
advancement of distributed computing.

They advocate distributed computing, by encouraging global
participation and contributions of processing power, bandwidth,
and expertise; by providing a forum for discussion; and by raising
awareness on the Internet and in the mainstream.

Current Project :

RC5-64:  distributed.net's longest-running project is the RC5-64
challenge. They're now cracking at 127.24 billion keys per second
and are moving through the keyspace faster every day.

Optimal 24 Mark Golomb Rulers:  Essentially, a Golomb Ruler is a
mathematical term given to a set of whole numbers where no two
pairs of numbers have the same difference. An Optimal Golomb Ruler
(OGR) is just like an everyday ruler, except that the marks are
placed so that no two pairs of marks measure the same distance.
OGR's have many uses in the real world.  They're now testing at
182.49 billion nodes per second.
