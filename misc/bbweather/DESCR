bbweather is a tool which displays the current weather conditions
in an decorated window, simulating the look of the Blackbox toolbar
(Blackbox is a Windowmanager for X11).  This tool is heavily based
on "bbdate" by John Kennis, almost 90% of the code (rough guess ;)
were taken over unaltered.  Furthermore, bbweather was inspired by
wmWeather by Michael G. Henderson, from where I grabbed the
perl-script that fetches the weather-conditions from your local
station.
