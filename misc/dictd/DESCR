DICTD is a DICT protocol server.

The Dictionary Server Protocol (DICT), described in RFC 2229, is a TCP
transaction based query/response protocol that allows a client to access
dictionary definitions from a set of natural language dictionary databases.

Some dictionary databases are freely available at dict.org.
