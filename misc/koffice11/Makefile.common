# On egcs-1.1.2, the C++ compiler system isn't quite ISO-compliant.  It lacks
# a std::auto_ptr implementation in <memory>, doesn't handle static inline
# functions in headers properly (although that concept, in itself, is quite
# flawed), and just plain has bugs when compiling large functions with
# optimization.  For certains parts of KOffice, we pass in
# ${OPTIMIZATION_BUG_CXXFLAGS}, which is meant to be appended to
# ${KDE_CXXFLAGS} so that it can turn off all code optimization by the
# compiler.
