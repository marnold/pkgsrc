The Open Type Organizer project provides programs to list, modify
OpenType font files, specifically, their 'name' and 'cmap' tables.
It can be used to translate the 'name' and 'cmap' of an OpenType font
in locale encodings to Unicode encodings so the font file can be
used in an environment which does not understand locale encodings.
The translated tables are added to the font while keeping the
original tables intact.

Have a True Type font which is not recognized by X Window system?
Chances are, the font is listed/indexed in an encoding other than
Unicode!  Open Type Organizer (oTo) will help to solve the problem.
It will list font file organization and even add Unicode 'name' and
'cmap' tables by translating the original ones.  Your favorite ttf
font can really work for you now.
