The Uptime Project consist of three parts, one tiny client that runs on each 
host that take part of the project, and sends information about it's uptime 
to the project. The second part is a central database-server that collects 
and stores updates from all participating hosts, and the third part which is 
this website, where statistics can be viewed, and users can administrate 
their accounts and add new hosts.
