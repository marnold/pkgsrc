  OpenOffice has now been installed in ${PREFIX}/OpenOffice.org641.

  Before using this package for the first time, each user has to run
  a setup program, which is automatically invoked at the first start.  
  Thereafter, OpenOffice can be started using the 
  ${PREFIX}/bin/soffice command.

  Please note that this software should be considered alpha quality
  at the moment, i.e. take extra care when using it in production
  environments.
