CryptoFS is a encrypted filesystem for Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE).

CryptoFS will use a normal directory to store files encrypted. The
mountpoint will contain the decrypted files. Every file stored in
this mountpoint will be written encrypted (data and filename) to the
directory that was mounted. If you unmount the directory the encrypted
data can only be access by mounting the directory with the correct key
again.
