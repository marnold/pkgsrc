The goal of IceWM is to provide a small, fast and familiar window
manager for the X11 window system. Compatibility with the mwm window
manager is desired and will be implemented where appropriate.

The IceWM is designed to emulate the look of Motif, OS/2 Warp 4, OS/2
Warp 3 and Windows 95. Others might added in the future.

It also tries to combine the feel of the above systems whenever it is
compatible.

Generally, it tries to make all functions available both by keyboard
and by mouse (this is not currently possible when using mouse focus).

Extreme configurability similiar to fvwm and many other window
managers is NOT the goal.
