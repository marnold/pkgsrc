Xmeter displays a number of remote machine load meters.  This package
monitors system activity, displaying a histogram of data returned by
rstat(3) as a meter.  It can be told to monitor multiple hosts, or to
monitor multiple statistics on the same host.  Meters can be displayed
in a vertical, horizontal or rectangular arrangement.  As statistics
range between 4 user defineable levels (OK, WARN, ERROR or FATAL), the
background, foreground, highlight, border and internal border colors,
and the background bitmap of each meter can be changed.  Xmeter uses
the StripChart widget of the Athena Widget Set to graph each
statistic.
