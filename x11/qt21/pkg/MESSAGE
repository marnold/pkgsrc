To allow this
package to coexist with other versions of Qt, it has been installed
in ${X11BASE}/qt21/{bin,include,lib,doc}.

You should be able to select this version of Qt when compiling
programs which use it by ensuring that

1) QTDIR is set to ${X11BASE}/qt21

2) Use the "configure" argument "--with-qt-dir=${X11BASE}/qt21"

3) you may also have to put ${X11BASE}/qt21/bin in your PATH

To access Qt-2.1 man pages add ${X11BASE}/qt21/doc/man to your MANPATH
environment variable.  Note that the Qt-2.1 man pages are installed
here to avoid conflicts with man pages of other Qt versions.
