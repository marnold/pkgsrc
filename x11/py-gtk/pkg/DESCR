PyGTK
=====
Author: James Henstridge <james@daa.com.au>

This archive contains modules that allow you to use gtk in Python
programs.  At present, it is a fairly complete set of bindings.
Despite the low version number, this piece of software is quite
useful, and is usable to write moderately complex programs.  (see the
examples directory for some examples of the simpler programs you could
write).

If you have any enhancements or bug reports, please send them to me at
james@daa.com.au.  If you are going to send me diffs, my prefered
format is unified diff (ie. diff -u), followed by context diffs.
Please don't send me diffs which don't have any context, as these are
almost useless if I try to apply them manually, or have a different
version of the source tree.
