The AfterStep Control Panel is intended to provide an easy to use
and intuitive graphical front-end for configuring the AfterStep
window manager (versions 1.4 and up).

Although based (read: looks like) on a previous program of the same
name written in Tcl/Tk (Alfredo Kojima, Ludovic Marcotte and Nwanua
Elumeze), this version (also dubbed gtk+-ascp), works with the
~/GNUstep/ directory structure. It is written in C using the GTK+
toolkit and as such bears only a visual resemblance to its predecessor.
