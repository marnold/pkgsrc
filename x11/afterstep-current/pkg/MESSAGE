FIRST TIME USERS:
To use afterstep as your window manager, simply invoke "exec afterstep"
at the end of your .xinitrc (for "startx), or .xsession file (for xdm).
Don't forget to comment out any line(s) for your current window manager.

UPGRADERS:
Afterstep-1.7.x is more configurable than ever, but take notice: the format
of many of the configuration files has changed! Upgraders are advised to
back up their old ~/Gnu/Library/Afterstep directory, permit afterstep to
create a new one, and then review the documentation while examining diffs.
Note especially that with the new ".include" file mechanism: 1) it is not
necessary to maintain a complete copy of @PREFIX@share/afterstep
in each home directory, and 2) it is now possible to set site- and host-
wide policys.

EVERYBODY:
The AfterStep Control Panel for 1.7.x is still under development.
See the online docs (Wharf top button or bottom item of start menu)
for configuration instructions, or try the following urls:
