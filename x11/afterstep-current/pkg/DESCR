AfterStep is a Window Manager for X which started by emulating the
NEXTSTEP look and feel, but which has been significantly altered according
to the requests of various users. Many adepts will tell you that NEXTSTEP
is not only the most visually pleasant interface, but also one of the most
functional and intuitive out there. AfterStep aims to incorporate the
advantages of the NEXTSTEP interface, and add additional useful features.
