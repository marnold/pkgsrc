Please note that this package is provided for those programs
which will not work with newer versions of Qt.  To allow this
package to coexist with newer versions of Qt the manual pages
all have "_1" appended.  For example instead of 'man qwidget'
you would use 'man qwidget_1' to get the Qt1 version of the
manual page.  The header files have been installed in
${PREFIX}/include/qt1 and the meta object compiler (moc) has
been installed as "moc1".
