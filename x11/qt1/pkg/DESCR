Qt is a toolkit for building a GUI for X in C++. The main documentation
is in ${PREFIX}/share/doc/qt1 and is also available on the web. This
directory also contains a tutorial, and example programs (aclock, biff,
connect, cursor, dclock, desktop, drawdemo, forever, hello, life, menu,
makepic/ showpic, qmag, showimg, tetris, tictac, timestmp, widgets,
xform, xshape) have also been installed.

This version of the pkg is intended to provide support for those pkgs
which will not work with more recent versions of Qt.
