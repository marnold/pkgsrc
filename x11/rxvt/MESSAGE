The rxvt binary is able to use greek keyboard extensions and
multibyte character encodings. Due to errors in the current
version, the greek keyboard support is not compiled into the
binary (it can not be disabled at runtime and causes problems
for users in other locales).

The multibyte character encoding support is compiled in, but
by default disabled. To enable it, please edit the file 
${PREFIX}/lib/X11/app-defaults/Rxvt.
