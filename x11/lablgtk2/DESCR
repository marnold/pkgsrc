LablGTK is an Objective Caml interface to GTK+.  This version, LablGTK2, has
support for GTK+ from 2.0 to 2.6.

It uses the rich type system of Objective Caml 3 to provide a strongly typed,
yet very comfortable, object-oriented interface to GTK+.  This is not that
easy if you know the dynamic typing approach taken by GTK+.
