  GToolKit is an Objective-C interface library to the GTK+ widget set.
GTK+, which stands for the Gimp Toolkit, is a library for creating
graphical user interfaces for the X Window System and MS Win32.

  There are already a number of different Objective-C interface libraries
around and each one has its own features, so you have to decide for
yourself which one to try and use.  This package uses NSObject as its
base class and requires a Foundation implementation.  Almost all source
files are automatically generated from the GTK include files, so
upgrading to newer versions of GTK should not be a problem.
