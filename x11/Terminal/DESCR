Terminal is a modern terminal emulator for the Unix/Linux desktop -
primarly for the Xfce desktop environment.  It was developed because
of the need for a lightweight and easy to use terminal emulator in the
Xfce desktop environment, that doesn't require the user to install the
GNOME plattform, but still provides a worthy alternative to the GNOME
terminal emulator.
