XPenguins is a simple program that animates a number of penguins that
fall from the top of the screen, walk along the top of windows, up
the side of windows, up the side of the screen, and sometimes even
levitate with their genetically-modified go-go-gadget 'copter
ability. Use the `-h' option to see a list of current options -
currently you can specify the display to send the penguins to, the
delay between frames and the number of penguins that are created.
