Scwm is the Scheme Configurable/Constraints Window Manager.  It is a
window manager with a powerful dynamic configuration language based on
Guile Scheme.  Scwm has many, many advanced features, often
implemented in the configuration language itself.  It is in active
development currently, and continues to improve.

Scwm was originally based on fvwm2 code.  Though the internals are
almost completely rewritten, we have strived to maintain compatibility
on various levels.  For example, even fvwm2 modules may be executed
through an adapter written in Scwm scheme code.
