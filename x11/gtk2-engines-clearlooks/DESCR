Clearlooks is new and modern-looking GTK2+ engine, based on Bluecurve.
It has the looks of various themes blended together, resulting in a
theme that's easy on the eyes and visually pleasing.

The difference with pixmap based themes is that it does not sacrifice
a lot of speed.  In fact, it is roughly as fast as Bluecurve.
