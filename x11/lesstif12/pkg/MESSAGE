Please note that this package is provided for those programs
which will not work with newer versions of LessTif.  To allow this
package to coexist with newer versions of LessTif, it has been installed
in ${PREFIX}/LessTif/1.2/{include,lib}.

You should be able to select this version of LessTif when compiling
programs which use it by passing the following flags to the compiler:

	-I${PREFIX}/LessTif/1.2/include
	-L${PREFIX}/LessTif/1.2/lib -Wl,-R${PREFIX}/LessTif/1.2/lib
