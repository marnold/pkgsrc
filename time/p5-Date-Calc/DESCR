This package consists of a C library and a Perl module (which uses
the C library, internally) for all kinds of date calculations based
on the Gregorian calendar (the one used in all western countries
today), thereby complying with all relevant norms and standards:
ISO/R 2015-1971, DIN 1355 and, to some extent, ISO 8601 (where
applicable).

(See also http://www.engelschall.com/u/sb/download/Date-Calc/DIN1355/
for a scan of part of the "DIN 1355" document (in German)).

The module of course handles year numbers of 2000 and above correctly
("Year 2000" or "Y2K" compliance) -- actually all year numbers from
1 to the largest positive integer representable on your system
(which is at least 32767) can be dealt with.
